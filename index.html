Lewis: Essays and Memoirs by Philip Yancey, J. I.Packer, Charles Colson, George Sayer, James Houston, Don Bede Griffiths and Others</h2><p>A collection of essays by some of the nation&#39;s most important evangelical writers focuses on C. S. Lewis as an influencial Christian writer. Original.</p><p>We Remember C.S. Lewis is a collection of essays, memoirs, and letters contributed by some 30 people who had contact with Lewis or are familiar with his work. Most of these essays first appeared in various issues of The Canadian C.S. Lewis Journal and together constitute a sequel to Stephen Schofield's In Search of C.S. Lewis. Contributors vary from former pupils to letter correspondents to his gardener Paxford (who was the model for the character of Puddleglum in The Chronicles of Narnia.) <p>The format is similar to the reminiscences of James T. Como's C.S. Lewis at the Breakfast Table. Included in the essays is a piece written by Lewis himself entitled "What France Means to You." It originally appeared in a French Journal during World War II and now is published in a book for the first time. </p><p>For readers of C.S. Lewis, this volume will further enhance their enjoyment of his writing. For those unfamiliar with Lewis, this work provides an introduction to the man and some of the things in which he took interest, for which his lucid and insightful writing found full expression.</p>David Graham is a surgeon and a contributing editor to The Canadian C.S. Lewis Journal. He has published a book of essays entitles Thoughts Along the Way. He resides in Knoxville, Tennessee.</p><h2>Dangerous Work: Diary of an Arctic Adventure</h2><p><p>In 1880 a young medical student named Arthur Conan Doyle embarked upon the &#x201c;first real outstanding adventure&#x201d; of his life, taking a berth as ship&#x2019;s surgeon on an Arctic whaler, the <i>Hope</i>. The voyage took him to unknown regions, showered him with dramatic and unexpected experiences, and plunged him into dangerous work on the ice floes of the Arctic seas. He tested himself, overcame the hardships, and, as he wrote later, &#x201c;came of age at 80 degrees north latitude.&#x201d;</p>Conan Doyle&#x2019;s time in the Arctic provided powerful fuel for his growing ambitions as a writer. With a ghost story set in the Arctic wastes that he wrote shortly after his return, he established himself as a promising young writer. A subsequent magazine article laying out possible routes to the North Pole won him the respect of Arctic explorers. And he would call upon his shipboard experiences many times in the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, who was introduced in 1887&#x2019;s <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>.&nbsp;Out of sight for more than a century was a diary that Conan Doyle kept while aboard the whaler. <i>Dangerous Work: Diary of an Arctic Adventure </i>makes this account available for the first time in a beautiful facsimile edition that reproduces Conan Doyle&#x2019;s notebook pages in his own elegant hand, accompanied by his copious illustrations. With humor and grace, Conan Doyle provides a vivid account of a long-vanished way of life at sea. His careful detailing of the experience of arctic whaling is equal parts fascinating and alarming, revealing the dark workings of the later days of the British whaling industry. In addition to the facsimile and annotated transcript of the diary, the volume contains photographs of the <i>Hope</i>, its captain, and a young Conan Doyle on deck with its officers; two nonfiction pieces by Doyle about his experiences; and two of his tales inspired by the journey.&nbsp;To the end of his life, Conan Doyle would look back on this experience with awe: &#x201c;You stand on the very brink of the unknown,&#x201d; he declared, &#x201c;and every duck that you shoot bears pebbles in its gizzard which come from a land which the maps know not. It was a strange and fascinating chapter of my life.&#x201d; Only now can the legion of Conan Doyle fans read and enjoy that chapter.<p>A special limited, numbered edition of the clothbound book is also available. In addition, a text-only e-book edition is&nbsp;published as <i>Dangerous Work: Diary of an Arctic Adventure, Text-only Edition.</i></p></p><p><p><b>Arthur Conan Doyle</b> (1859&#x2013;1930) was a British physician and writer most noted for his stories about the detective Sherlock Holmes. <b>Jon Lellenberg</b> and <b>Daniel Stashower </b>are the editors of <i>Arthur Conan Doyle: A Life in Letters</i> and Conan Doyle&#x2019;s first novel, <i>The Narrative of John Smith</i>.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What does <i>Dangerous Work</i> have in common with <i>Moby-Dick</i>? A few of a hundred possible answers: Both books disguise great depth beneath the cloak of an adventure story. Both offer accounts of what was once a major industry, comparable in relative terms to today&#x2019;s oil industry. Both should be read from cover to cover, shared with friends and revisited in front of a warm fire. And both, for different reasons, are books to treasure, the kind that kindle and rekindle a love of words and a feeling of irredeemable debt to the men behind them.&#x201d; (Bill Streever <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Even if this diary of the nineteenth-century whaling ship <i>Hope</i>&#x2019;s Arctic exploits didn&#x2019;t come from Sherlock Holmes&#x2019;s creator, it would still make fascinating reading, especially for Patrick O'Brian fans. . . . Though Doyle, a medical student serving aboard as ship&#x2019;s doctor, was just twenty at the time, his gifts for writing and observation are already much in evidence, as when he observes &#x2018;hillocks&#x2019; of ice &#x2018;rising and falling with the waves, pure white above and of a wonderful green below.&#x2019;. . . Similar to Christopher Tolkien's work on his father's unpublished writings, this diary&#x2019;s publication adds both to the still-growing body of Doyle&#x2019;s early work and to our understanding of what made him tick.&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;For 130 years, this amazing diary, written by the creator of Sherlock Holmes, has lain hidden. Only now have Sir Arthur&#x2019;s descendants consented to its publication. It is probably one of the most exciting literary finds of recent years, for it sheds an entirely new light on a writer we thought we knew so well.&#x201d; (Philip Hoare <i>Daily Mail</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[W]orthwhile not least for Conan Doyle&#x2019;s whimsical illustrations. . . . In books by and about Arthur Conan Doyle, all roads lead to Holmes, and this book is, not at all regrettably, no exception. . . . <i>Dangerous Work</i> is the richer for showing not just Conan Doyle&#x2019;s proto-Holmesian work, but also his tendencies to romanticize his experience and to enliven it with a well-chosen white lie. One of the most amusing things that emerges when all of his Arctic writings are brought together is just how often he revisited and revised his memories of the expedition.&#x201d; (Laura Marsch <i>New Republic</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[T]here is something thrilling about reading Doyle&#x2019;s observations almost straight from his own pen.&#x201d; (Jan Gardner <i>Boston Globe</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This visually very pleasing volume is sturdily bound, beautifully printed, and very reasonably priced. . . .

[It] is an essential volume for any Doylean&#x2019;s collection, but it will also excite anyone with a taste for Victorian adventure and provide an inspiring source for scholars working on the life and times of Sherlock Holmes and his creator.&#x201d; (<i>Sherlock Holmes Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This reissue of Conan Doyle&#x2019;s original diary from his 1880 voyage on the whaling vessel <i>Hope</i> is fascinating both as a historical document and for its insight into the mind of a literary giant. . . . [Y]ou don't need to be a Conan Doyle scholar to enjoy the hell out of <i>Dangerous Work</i>. This is a title to read as literary and whaling history and, at its most basic, one young man's journey into a dangerous place and having his adventure. The University of Chicago Press rolls out the royal treatment for Conan Doyle with their design, providing an entire facsimile of the diary in the first half of the volume. The pages are sepia, Conan Doyle&#x2019;s drawings are crisp, his maps are clear, his renderings of the <i>Hope</i>, the animals they encountered and his crewmates are all gorgeously reproduced (this is the kind of diary we all dream of keeping), and he tells his story in perfect script, on straight lines, in a manner that begs to be read.&#x201d; (Colleen Mondor <i>Bookslut</i>)</p><h2>The Cradle King: A Life of James I and VI</h2><p>Chatto &amp; Windus 2003 1st edition 3rd print edition hardcover fine condition book in fine condition dw .

Grades 2-4. --Daniel Kraus</p><h2>The Conquerors: Roosevelt, Truman and the Destruction of Hitler&#39;s Germany, 1941-1945</h2><p>From one of America&#39;s most respected historians, The Conquerors reveals one of the most important stories of World War II. As Allied soldiers fought the Nazis, Franklin Roosevelt and, later, Harry Truman fought in private with Churchill and Stalin over how to ensure that Germany could never threaten the world again. Eleven years in the writing, drawing on newly opened American, Soviet and British documents as well as private diaries, letters and secret audio recordings, Michael Beschloss&#39;s gripping narrative lets us eavesdrop on private conversations and telephone calls among a cast of historical giants. The book casts new light upon Roosevelt&#39;s concealment of what America knew about Hitler&#39;s war against the Jews and his foot-dragging on saving refugees; FDR&#39;s actions so shocked his closest friend in the Cabinet, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., that Morgenthau risked their friendship by accusing the President of &#34;acquiescence&#34; in the &#34;murder of the Jews.&#34; After the Normandy invasion, &#34;obsessed&#34; by what he had learned about the Nazis and the Holocaust, Morgenthau drew up a secret blueprint for the Allies to crush Germany by destroying German mines and factories after the European victory. As The Conquerors shows, FDR endorsed most of Morgenthau&#39;s plan, and privately pressured a reluctant Churchill to concur. Horrified, Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Secretary of War Henry Stimson leaked the plan to the press at the zenith of the 1944 campaign. Hitler&#39;s propagandist Joseph Goebbels denounced the Roosevelt-Churchill &#34;Jewish murder plan&#34; and claimed it would kill forty-three million Germans. Republican presidential candidate Thomas Dewey charged that by stiffening German resistance, publicity about Morgenthau&#39;s plan had cost many U.S. soldiers&#39; lives. The Conquerors explores suspicions that Soviet secret agents manipulated Roosevelt and his officials to do Stalin&#39;s bidding on Germany. It reveals new information on FDR&#39;s hidden illnesses and how they affected his leadership -- and his private talk about quitting his job during his fourth term and letting Harry Truman become President. It shows us FDR&#39;s final dinner, in April 1945, in Warm Springs, Georgia, at which the President and Morgenthau were still arguing over postwar Germany. Finally it shows how the unprepared new President Truman managed to pick up the pieces and push Stalin and Churchill to accede to a bargain that would let the Anglo-Americans block Soviet threats against Western Europe and ensure that the world would not have to fear another Adolf Hitler.</p><p>Long before an Allied victory was assured during World War II, the Big Three--Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin--began discussing how to prevent Germany from ever again threatening the world. The fact that Germany today is a peaceful, democratic ally of the U.S. is "one of America's great twentieth-century international achievements," writes esteemed historian Michael Beschloss. How such a transformation was accomplished is the subject of <i>The Conquerors</i>.<p> Drawing on thousands of previously unreleased documents, secret audio recordings, private diaries, and other information recently made available, Beschloss details the complex diplomacy between the Allied leaders, including their differences over whether to demand Germany's unconditional surrender; how, if at all, to divide Germany after the war; and how to effectively punish Germany without creating the kind of resentment that led to the rise of Hitler. The relationship between the three leaders, and later, Truman, is fascinating, as Beschloss reveals private conversations, ulterior motives, and numerous back-channel deals that took place. Of particular interest is the maneuvering of Roosevelt and Churchill, who were both concerned that the Soviets would attempt a postwar power grab in Western Europe if given the chance. The book also deals with Roosevelt's reluctance to deal with Germany's systematic extermination of the Jews, and the role that his old friend and Treasury Secretary, Henry Morgenthau, Jr., played in pushing the President into action. After learning of the Holocaust, Morgenthau became obsessed with punishing Germany severely, drafting a plan that called for the complete destruction of their mines and factories as a way of forcing Germany into subsistence farming--ideas that put him at odds with Secretary of State Cordell Hull, Secretary of War Henry Stimson, and many others in the administration.</p><p> <i>The Conquerors</i> is a superbly written, if brief, treatment of the political events leading up to the defeat of Germany, with the main players brought vividly to life by Beschloss's keen eye for detail and his ability to expose the human strengths and weaknesses of the participants. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p><b>Michael Beschloss</b> has been called by <i>Newsweek</i> "the nation's leading Presidential historian."

In certain cultures, distaffs evolved over centuries from plain sticks to surprisingly ornate sculptures. They eventually became important cultural objects, with almost ritualistic significance.</p><p>During a heyday lasting from the mid 18th century to the early 20th century, distaff production soared. This production was ultimately quashed by the progress of the Industrial Revolution and subsequent availability of ready-made fabric. Distaff use continued, but primarily to honor tradition and create special textiles of cultural and familial importance, rather than make clothes for daily wear.</p></p><p><p>MICHAEL T.

He revolutionized the field of topology, which studies properties of geometric configurations that are unchanged by stretching or twisting. The Poincar� conjecture lies at the heart of modern geometry and topology, and even pertains to the possible shape of the universe. The conjecture states that there is only one shape possible for a finite universe in which every loop can be contracted to a single point. </p><p>Poincar�'s conjecture is one of the seven "millennium problems" that bring a one-million-dollar award for a solution. Grigory Perelman, a Russian mathematician, has offered a proof that is likely to win the Fields Medal, the mathematical equivalent of a Nobel prize, in August 2006. He also will almost certainly share a Clay Institute millennium award. </p><p>In telling the vibrant story of <i>The Poincar� Conjecture</i>, Donal O'Shea makes accessible to general readers for the first time the meaning of the conjecture, and brings alive the field of mathematics and the achievements of generations of mathematicians whose work have led to Perelman's proof of this famous conjecture.</p></p><p><p><b>Donal O'Shea</b> is professor of mathematics and dean of faculty at Mount Holyoke College. He has written scholarly books and monographs, and his research articles have appeared in numerous journals and collections. He lives in South Hadley, Massachusetts.</p>&#x201c;Mathematical knowledge builds on the work of those who have gone before us. Any one of us with an elementary school education can solve arithmetic and algebraic problems that would have defeated the most learned Babylonian scribes. Any one of us with a few courses of calculus and linear algebra can solve problems that Pythagoras, Archimedes, or even Newton could not have touched. A mathematics graduate student today can handle topological calculations that Riemann and Poincar� could not have begun. We are not smarter than they. Rather, we are their beneficiaries.&#x201d;</p><h2>Philo: Volume X, On the Embassy to Gaius.

Today the situation is so bad that less than one-third of the members in some churches attend worship services. Church leaders are crying for help.In an effort to help church leaders, the Billy Graham School of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary conducted a massive research project involving nearly 287 churches. The most revealing aspect of the study was that the higher expectations placed on members, the greater the likelihood that the members would stay and be involved with the church. Using the data gathered from this project, Thom Rainer presents the first-ever comprehensive study about &#39;closing the back door.&#39; Rainer looks at why people are leaving the church and how church leaders can keep the members.</p><p><b>Thom S.

Years later this same little girl went on to college, and hoping to pass the story on to others asked her friend and fellow classmate, Prabhjot Jody Uppal, to put pictures to the Little Bird story. Over the past several years Peter A. Campbell, Ph.D. has helped coordinate the process of illustrating this wonderful story that is a joy to share with others. The growing worldwide problem of increasing violence and how we effectively diminish this is at the heart of Dr. McMahon&#39;s life&#39;s work. He has found that once adults develop a habit of noticing and nurturing their own important feelings they can become creative in guiding children of all ages into learning the same habit of how to take care of their own feelings. Passing on this more embodied experience is the key to nurturing future peacemakers from the inside.</p><p>Edwin M. McMahon, Ph.D. is a teacher, author, psychotherapist, priest and cofounder of the Institute for BioSpiritual Research who has spent his life researching how parents, child caregivers, teachers and other who interact with children can personally learn to experience an inner process that creates human wholeness. The Little Bird story does this not only because it uses a non-technical, non-abstract story line, but because it neither accuses or blames, nor arouses resistance or fear in the reader/listener. Instead, it moves directly and gently into the body&#39;s knowing where it can resonate with truths hidden within, stirring up a more embodied and meaningful connection that touches the readers/listener&#39;s life.</p><h2>Read with Me Bible</h2><p>Recounts Bible stories from the Old and New Testaments adapted from the New International Reader&#39;s Version of the Bible</p><p>The Popular Read With Me Bible Is Better Than Ever!

In 1993, soldier-turned-award-winning-artist Simon Combes set out to observe and paint the nine great cats of the world in their natural habitats. Combes circled the globe to accomplish this feat, braving blizzards and blowguns. He breaks his account down into three three-cat sections: Cats of the Jungle (Thailand's Clouded Leopard, Venezuela's Jaguar, and India's Bengal Tiger), Cats of the Snow (Siberia's Siberian Tiger, Mongolia's Snow Leopard, North America's Cougar), and Cats of the Plains (Kenya's Cheetah and Tanzania's Leopard and Lion). <p>Combes's skillful sketches and photographic paintings are matched only by his fresh and engaging commentary. As a gifted artist, Combes is very perceptive, and he employs this talent both on and off the canvas, making wry and sometimes hysterical observations of the human subjects he encounters. The cats, however, are given only reverent scrutiny, and anyone who is drawn to the power and beauty of these regal creatures will find Combes a kindred spirit and capable guide. One of the most thoughtful additions to the book is an information box for each cat, detailing its behavior, habitat, population status, and principal threats. Combes gravely notes that the most serious threat to each of the cats is human encroachment on its dwindling habitat. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Simon Combes was born in England and moved at the age of six to a farm in Kenya&#39;s Great Rift Valley. Later, he attended The Duke of York School in Nairobi, and spent free time wandering Lord Delamere&#39;s 50,000 acre ranch at Elementeita where his father was a cattle manager. Here he developed an early love and knowledge of wilderness and wildlife. In 1958 he was drafted into the Kenyan army, and after completing his service, applied for a commission in the Kings African Rifles, a local army commanded and administered by the British colonial regime. In 1960 he was accepted for the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, but was first assigned to &#34;training&#34; in Uganda&#39;s 4th KAR, where his primary responsibility became grooming one of the battalion&#39;s future leaders: Idi Amin. For five years following his Sandhurst training, (and Kenya&#39;s independence,) Combes served with the Kenyan army in the guerrilla war with neighboring Somalia. In 1969, a near sell-out of his paintings at the New Stanley Art Gallery in Nairobi planted a glimmer of an idea that art could be an alternative career. A full-time artist since 1974, Simon lives England, but returns to his beloved Kenya for three months each winter as (photographic) safari guide. He sits on the boards of several wildlife conservation organizations, and has raised, through his art, many thousands of dollars for their causes. He has won numerous fine art awards, and his paintings are in collections around the globe.</p><h2>Welcome to Night Vale: A Novel</h2><p><p>From the creators of the wildly popular&nbsp;<em>Welcome to Night Vale</em>&nbsp;podcast comes an imaginative mystery of appearances and disappearances that is also a poignant look at the ways in which we all struggle to find ourselves...no matter where we live.</p><p>"Hypnotic and darkly funny. . . .

An invaluable record of a stunningly original and consistently idealistic American mind. Foreword by Michael Walzer.<br></p><p>Irving Howe (June 11, 1920 &#x2013; May 5, 1993), was an American literary and social critic. He was born as Irving Horenstein in The Bronx, New York, as a son of immigrants who ran a small grocery store that went out of business during the Great Depression. He never publicly explained his name change from "Horenstein" to "Howe." <br> <p><br>Like many New York Intellectuals, Howe attended City College and graduated in 1940, alongside Daniel Bell and Irving Kristol. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II. Upon his return, he began writing literary and cultural criticism for the influential <i>Partisan Review</i> and became a frequent essayist for <i>Commentary</i>, <i>Politics</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, <i>The New Republic</i>, and <i>The New York Review of Books</i>. In 1954, Howe helped found the intellectual quarterly <i>Dissent</i>, which he edited until his death in 1993. In the 1950's Howe taught English and Yiddish literature at Brandeis University in Waltham, MA. He used the Howe and Greenberg Treasury of Yiddish Stories as the text for a course on the Yiddish story at a time when few were spreading knowledge or appreciation of these works in American colleges and universities.<br><br></p> <p>Since his CCNY days, Howe was committed to left-wing politics. He was a member of the Young People's Socialist League and then Max Shachtman's Workers Party, where Shactman made Howe his understudy. After 1948, he joined the Independent Socialist League, where he was a central leader. He left the ISL in the early 1950s. As the request of his friend Michael Harrington, he helped co-found the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee in the early 1970s. DSOC merged into the Democratic Socialists of America in 1982, with Howe as a vice-chair. He was a vociferous opponent of both Soviet totalitarianism and McCarthyism, called into question standard Marxist doctrine, and came into conflict with the New Left after criticizing their unmitigated radicalism. Later in life, his politics gravitated toward more pragmatic democratic socialism and foreign policy, a position still represented in the idiosyncratic political and social arguments of <i>Dissent</i>.<br><br></p> <p>Known for literary criticism as well social and political activism, Howe wrote seminal studies on Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, politics and the novel, and a sweeping cultural history of Eastern European Jews in America entitled <i>World of Our Fathers</i>. He also edited and translated many Yiddish stories, and commissioned the first English translation of Isaac Bashevis Singer for the <i>Partisan Review</i>. He also wrote <i>A Margin of Hope</i>, his autobiography, and <i>Socialism and America</i>.</p> <p>A biography of Howe, entitled <i>Irving Howe: A Life of Passionate Dissent</i>, was published by Gerald Sorin. <br></p>Fire, insight and humanity characterize National Book Award-winner Howe's essays on individual authors, the Reagan era and the failures of liberalism and socialism in America. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Howe, a historian and critic of formidable intellect who has written extensively on politics (particularly socialism), literature, and history for 40 years, here shows how effectively he has mastered the trick of capturing recent literary and political events. These representative essays are densely crafted and display a virtuosity in their respective and often conjoined subject areas, which range from T.E. Lawrence to Ronald Reagan, anarchy to styles in leftism, and Robert Frost to Louis-Ferdinand Celine. The longer pieces, which provide extensive background and analysis, are the most effective. Their difficulty varies, but these essays require an earnest reader; academic and large public libraries would benefit from this collection. --Janice Braun, Medical Historical Lib., Yale Univ.<br> (<i>Library Journal</i>)</p><h2>Boy Scouts of America Scout Stuff</h2><p><p>In association with the National Scouting Museum, Boy Scouts expert Robert Birkby guides readers through a hundred years of Scouting in this visual guide to Boy Scouts collectibles.

The capital of Italy&#39;s economic miracle of the 1950s and 60s, Milan was a magnet for immigrants, as industry, design and culture created a heady mix of wealth, innovation and conflict. By the 1980s, heavy industry had all but disappeared and the city had reinvented itself as the world capital of fashion and a dynamic post-industrial metropolis. Meanwhile, the urban landscape was darkened by the bleak estates of the peripheries and the corruption scandals that exploded in what became known as &#39;Tangentopoli&#39;, or Bribesville. This fascinating book traces Milan&#39;s &#39;biography&#39; through its buildings, design, fashion, cinema, families, immigrants and television. The city emerges as a potent economic power-house and laboratory for change, where art and culture converge in a modern but problematic urban space.

As trappers in a hostile, trackless land, their exploits opened the gates of the mountains for the wagon trains of pioneers who followed them. In Give Your Heart to the Hawks, Win Blevins presents a poetic tribute to these dauntless &#34;first Westerners&#34; and their incredible adventures. Here, among many, are the stories of:* John Colter, who, in 1808, naked and without weapons or food, escaped captivity by the Blackfeet and ran and walked 250 miles to Fort Lisa at the mouth of the Yellowstone River;* Hugh Glass, who was mauled by a grizzly in 1823, left for dead by his trapper companions, and crawled 300 miles to Fort Kiowa on the Missouri; * Kit Carson, who ran away from home at age 17, became a legendary mountain man in his 20s and served as scout and guide for John C.

Win's childhood was spent roaming, his dad a railroad man. Win went to school in St. Louis, and the family spent summers in little towns along the tracks of the railroads. He listened to the whistles blow at night and wanted to go wherever the trains went.<br>Seldom has a young man been in more of a hurry. Using scholarships, Win ran through a succession of colleges, receiving his master's degree, with honors, in English from Columbia University. He taught at Purdue University and Franklin College, then received a fellowship to attend USC. Win became a newspaperman - a music, theater, and film critic for both major Los Angeles papers. In 1972 he took the big leap-he quit his job to write out his passions-exploring and learning wild places-full time. His greatest passion of all has been to set the stories of these places, their people and animals, colors and smells, into books.<br>Win climbed mountains for ten years. A fluke blizzard caught him on a mountaintop and froze his feet, an end to climbing mountains, but not to exploring them. He's rafted rivers in the west, particularly the Snake and the San Juan, and was briefly a river guide. His love of the great Yellowstone River gave him a fine appreciation for the people who first loved these wild places. Along the way, Win lost the use of his legs and learned to sail, deciding a boat was a good place for a man without legs. He regained the use of his legs, and maintains his love of the open seas. <br>His first book, <i>Give Your Heart to the Hawks</i>, is still in print after thirty years. Other works include <i>Stone Song</i>, a novel about Crazy Horse, for which he won the 1996 Mountains and Plains Booksellers Award and the 1996 Spur Award. He's written 15 books, including a Dictionary of the American West, numerous screenplays and magazine articles. <br>He lives quietly in the canyon country of Utah. His passions grow with time-his wife Meredith, the center of his life, their five kids and grandkids. Classical music, baseball, roaming red rock mesas in the astonishing countryside, playing music... He considers himself blessed to be one of the people creating new stories about the west, and is proud to call himself a member of the world's oldest profession-storyteller.</p><p>"It was an epic time, which lasted hardly more than a third of a century before civilization swarmed west on trails the mountain men had blazed. Now Blevins sees they are paid the awed honor that is due them, in a book which has the drama and suspense of a novel." &#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"Win Blevins has long since won his place among the West's very best." &#x2015;Tony Hillerman</p><p>"For the lover of the early West, it is good entertainment...with lots of color, suspense and excitement." <i>&#x2015;The Denver Post</i></p></p><h2>Pompeii and the Roman Villa: Art and Culture Around the Bay of Naples</h2><p><p><strong>A sumptuous survey of life and art in Pompeii, Herculaneum, and the surrounding towns before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, published in association with the National Gallery of Art.</strong></p> From the second century BC onward, prominent Romans retreated to their villas around the Bay of Naples, a popular vacation spot for relaxation and relief from the pressures of business. The picturesque bay provided an ideal setting in which to read and write, exercise, enjoy the gardens, admire the views, and entertain friends.Julius Caesar, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero all built seaside villas in Baiae, and the emperor Augustus vacationed in Sorrento, Capri, and Posillipo. The richly decorated imperial villas set high artistic standards in the region, and the sculptors and painters whom the emperors employed found clients among the urban and suburban elite in Pompeii and Herculaneum.The magnificent contents of these sumptuously appointed villas and townhouses are the subject of <em>Pompeii and the Roman Villa</em>, and with them the breadth and richness of cultural and artistic life that thrived around the Bay of Naples before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. An international team of experts, led by Carol C. Mattusch, examines this exquisite body of ancient Roman art, complemented by more than 200 lavish illustrations of paintings, sculpture, mosaics, frescoes, jewelry, glass, and more.With contributions by Mary Beard, Bettina Bergmann, Stefano De Caro, Pietro Giovanni Guzzo, Kenneth Lapatin, and Carol C.

He has seen wonderful miracles of provision and healing. In obedience to God&#39;s call he started preaching, which led into a healing ministry. He has also set up an AIDS orphanage and a 500-seat auditorium on his land. Still a farmer, he is now an international evangelist, travelling through Africa in a refitted yellow fire engine, and filling the largest venues in South Africa.

But during what should have been a simple transfer, seven rare, priceless sapphires vanish without a trace, along with their courier, her brother Lee, who now, quite possibly, is dead. And suddenly Kate is on the run, pursued by federal agents who believe she's the criminal mastermind of a cunning bait-and-switch.</p><p>Only Kate suspects the terrifying truth: that she's stumbled into a conspiracy of deceit, betrayal, and cold-blooded murder that goes far beyond a simple jewel heist.

She lives in the Sierra Nevada Mountains with her husband, with whom she writes novels under a pseudonym. Her favorite activity is exploring the Western United States to find the landscapes that speak to her soul and inspire her writing.</p>A rogue FBI agent and a sexy gem-cutter, an abundance of pheromones, and the brutal deaths of several jewel couriers--these are the makings of a juicy plot about the theft of seven spectacular sapphires. Alas, it dribbles into disappointment. Carrington MacDuffie's efforts are superior, but even she can't hide the writing flaws. The dialogue strains credibility. The sexy romance between the special agent and the girl overwhelms the plot. Luckily, MacDuffie makes the trite sound true, and she has an impressive vocal range. She is believably masculine, throatily gruff as needed. Her women never simper unless they're supposed to. The story boasts improbable disguises, devious villains, and some absorbing bits about the trade in precious, semiprecious, and worthless stones. MacDuffie makes it worth a listen.

Ultimately, though, she settled on being a lawyer, working as a litigator at a large Washington firm.

After two years of carefully-enforced datelessness, she made one last foray onto Match.com, where she met her husband&#x2014;on her first match.<br><br>Mindy's travels have also taken her through various literary genres.

But she is beset with misgivings. She knows that the guild has named her as a traitor for her part in its downfall and ultimate banishment from Morenia. Desperately longing for reconciliation and the opportunity to prove her skills, she makes the journey to Brianta and the guild. She quickly learns that her presence there is an element in a conspiracy to gain control of Morenia's throne, and if she fails to accomplish the heinous task set for her by the Brotherhood, the lives of those she loves will be forfeit. The gods have other ideas, though, and they present a remarkable twist in events that Rani could never have predicted. Now the fate of Morenia and Brianta lies in the hands of the Thousand Gods and in the choice of one reluctant pilgrim. Ranita is a first-class heroine with a nose for high adventure, making this adventure pretty fabulous. <i>Paula Luedtke</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In spite of this, the people who have lived here since the Dreamtime have done more than simply eke out an existence, they have lived a comfortable life rich in ceremony and culture. Bushfires &amp; Bushtucker explains how the land's first inhabitants have not been passive figures in the landscape but have actively worked and changed their environment, often by means of fire. Their management of the country has allowed them to survive and prosper, to live through the worst droughts and reap the benefits of good times. This is the most comprehenisve survey ever published of desert plants and plant use. Pitjantjatjara, Warlpiri, Arrernte, Pintupi and many other Central Australian Aboriginal peoples have shared their knowledge with lifelong Centralian Peter Latz to produce this lively and accessible book.</p><p>Peter Latz was born in Alice Springs and raised in the Aboriginal community of Hermannsburg, 120 kilometres west of the Alice. His earliest memories are of forays for bushtucker with his young Arrernte friends. It was these trips that formed the basis of a lifelong interest in plants, and the subsequent research for Bushfires &amp; Bushtucker.

It supplies the meteorology needed to understand surface winds, and it shows how to predict the many kinds of wind shifts. Above all it shows how to take advantage of this special knowledge.</p><p>The book includes a wide range of illustrations in a section called "Winds of the World," showing how the wind behaves in many of the world's major racing areas. There are numerous examples of application of wind prediction to the planning of a race.

So I often invite a group of people over for small bites and cocktails instead. A cocktail party with appetizers lets your guests meet and mingle with new people.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hosting cocktail parties allows me to spend more time with my guests, because I don&#x2019;t have to always be jumping up and down, clearing plates, and serving the next course. I make sure to include a variety of appetizers. For an all-appetizers party, I allow for five or six hors d&#x2019;oeuvres per person, plus a dip or two. For a dinner party, I offer two or three appetizers before sitting down to the meal. At an elegant evening, I might offer French Onion Soup Dumplings, Bacon Cheese Straws, and Smoked Salmon Crostini with Avocado Cream accompanied by flutes of sparkling wine. If vegetarians are coming, I make sure to include Garlic-Curry Hummus and Sweet Potato Chips or Spinach-Feta Cups. A holiday party means more people of all ages and more food. Mini Crab Cakes with Old Bay Mayonnaise; my take on my mom&#x2019;s Sausage Party Bites; some Warm Bacon-Cheese Dip; and super creamy, super cheesy Mac &#x2019;n&#x2019; Cheese Bites offer something for everyone. Many of these recipes&#x2014;Potato Pierogies and Chicken Cheesesteak Egg Rolls, for example&#x2014;can be made ahead and frozen. That way you&#x2019;ll always have small bites of comfort at the ready for a fun and festive gathering.<br> &nbsp;<br> Buffalo Chicken Dip<br> FAN FAVORITE<br> &nbsp;<br> Buffalo chicken wings are a favorite of mine, especially when dining out. Once I see them on a menu, I usually go no further. Making them at home is more of a commitment than I usually have time for. Honestly, I&#x2019;d rather be with my guests than frying wings in the kitchen. So, whether it&#x2019;s movie night, game day, or party time, serve this warm, make-ahead dip that includes all the quintessential flavors of Buffalo chicken wings in one bowl. Surround it with an assortment of dippers, including celery and carrot sticks, broccoli florets, and tortilla, pita, or bagel chips. This dip is so good, I could lick the bowl. And I do. When no one is looking.<br> &nbsp;<br> Makes 6 cups<br> &nbsp;<br> 3 8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened<br> � cup bottled ranch dressing<br> � cup bottled blue cheese dressing<br> 1 cup Buffalo wing sauce<br> 2 store-bought rotisserie chickens, skin and bones removed and discarded, finely shredded<br> 3 cups (12 ounces) shredded Monterey Jack<br> Tortilla chips and carrot and celery sticks<br> &nbsp;<br> Preheat the oven to 375�F.<br> &nbsp;<br> Put the cream cheese, ranch dressing, blue cheese dressing, and wing sauce in a bowl. Whisk until creamy. Fold in the shredded chicken and 1� cups of the shredded cheese.<br> &nbsp;<br> Spread the mixture into a 3�-quart baking dish, cover, and bake for 20 minutes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Remove the dip from the oven and sprinkle the remaining 1� cups cheese on top. Bake, uncovered, for an additional 15 minutes, or until hot and bubbly. Let the dip cool for 10 minutes, then serve with tortilla chips, carrot sticks, and/or celery sticks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Warm Bacon&#x2013;Cheese Dip<br> &nbsp;<br> To me, cheese and bacon are two of God&#x2019;s most perfect foods, so I&#x2019;m always looking for new ways to combine them. When you serve this rich, comforting dip in a hollowed-out bread bowl, the presentation alone says, &#x201c;Party time!&#x201d; I like the mix of cheeses suggested below, but if you have a favorite blend, go for it. This dip lends itself well to most kinds of cheeses. For the bread bowl, I recommend a sourdough loaf, but any sturdy bread, like pumpernickel or rye, will work, too. It does take one hour for the dip to get hot all the way through, but trust me; it&#x2019;s definitely worth the wait.<br> &nbsp;<br> Makes 3� to 4 cups<br> &nbsp;<br> 1 pound bacon slices, softened<br> 1 cup chopped Vidalia onions<br> 1 8-inch round sourdough loaf<br> 1 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature<br> 1 cup sour cream<br> &#x2153; cup mayonnaise<br> 1 cup (4 ounces) shredded Monterey Jack<br> � cup (3 ounces) shredded yellow Cheddar<br> 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce<br> 1 scallion, thinly sliced, for garnish<br> &nbsp;<br> Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange the bacon in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Put the baking sheet in the cold oven. Turn on the oven to 400�F. Bake until the bacon is crispy, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the bacon from the pan and drain on paper towels. Save 2 to 3 tablespoons bacon drippings to saut� the onions. Reduce the oven temperature to 375�F. Once the bacon is cool, chop it into small pieces. Reserve � cup chopped bacon to garnish the dip.<br> &nbsp;<br> While the bacon is cooking, use a serrated knife to slice off the top quarter of the bread. Pull out most of the soft interior, leaving a 1-inch thickness on the inside. Cut the interior bread into cubes, place in a single layer on a baking sheet, and lightly toast in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Heat the reserved bacon drippings in a skillet over low heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and drain off any excess oil.<br> &nbsp;<br> While the onions are cooking, whisk together the cream cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, � cup of the Monterey Jack, � cup of the Cheddar, and the Worcestershire sauce in a bowl until smooth. Add the chopped bacon and the onions to the cream cheese mixture, stirring well. Spoon the dip into the hollowed-out bread. Wrap the bread with aluminum foil, place it on a baking sheet, and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil from the bread bowl and sprinkle the top with the remaining � cup Monterey Jack, the remaining � cup Cheddar, the reserved � cup chopped bacon, and the scallion. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.

Another collection of navel-gazing essays from a baby boomer who got hold of a fly rod and a word processor and thought Eureka, I've found myself. And now wants to share."</i> Any writer who can open a volume of, well, navel-gazing essays <i>that</i> self-effacingly has probably done some useful gazing, might actually have something worth saying, and has most likely manufactured a pretty good way of saying it. Fly-fishing is less avocation for James Babb, the editor of <i>Gray's Sporting Journal</i>, than a personal life choice. Born in the back of an ambulance in the parking lot of a Tennessee barbecue joint, he eventually resettled in New England. Through odd job after odd job, he found his equilibrium on the streams. When he wasn't out fly-fishing, he was thinking about it--and writing about it with unforced quirkiness and insight. In time, he built his own cabin in Maine with a trout pond to go with it. Why Maine? "I often say that I moved to Maine," he writes, "for the brook trout and Thoreau's wild North Woods and the joys of living in an inbred rural community where none of the cousins are mine." In a voice that's legitimately funny, magnetic, and unique, Babb has his say on just about everything from waders to wading staffs, British literature to knives and forks, which makes it a reader's adventure and an angler's catch. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>Jim Babb is one of the most eccentric and riveting new voices to be heard in the world of fly fishing in many years. From his early days growing up in a small East Tennessee town to his migration through Brahmin Boston to the backwoods of Maine (where he built his own house, by hand), Babb's story is as unique as it is brilliantly told. He explores his first fly rods in 'Blue Collar Cane'; his early use of the wet fly; and the expeditions he made for bream. Always, he fly fishes with a maverick genius, building a way of seeing and experiencing the world of fly fishing that is all his own, and that carries him from the ponds of Maine to great fly-fishing opportunities throughout the world as editor of Gray's Sporting Journal.

Delving into topics ranging from the production of wartime propaganda to the multimedia adaptations of romance narrative, contributors to the fourth volume in the <i>Mechademia</i> series address the political, cultural, and technological continuum between war and the everyday time of orderly social productivity that is reflected, confronted, and changed in manga, anime, and other forms of Japanese popular culture.</p><p>Grouped thematically, the essays in this volume explore the relationship between national sovereignty and war (from the militarization of children as critically exposed in <i>Grave of the Fireflies</i> to reworkings of Japanese patriotism in <i>The Place Promised in Our Early Days</i>), the intersection of war and the technologies of social control (as observed in the films of Oshii Mamoru and the apocalyptic vision of <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i>), history and memory as in manga artists working through the trauma of Japan's defeat in World War II and the new modalities of storytelling represented by <i>Final Fantasy X</i>), and the renewal and hybridization of militaristic genres as a means of subverting conventions (in Yamada Futaro's ninja fiction and Miuchi Suzue's girl knight manga).</p><p>Contributors: Brent Allison; Mark Anderson; Christopher Bolton, Williams College; Martha Cornog; Marc Driscoll, U of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; Angela Drummond-Mathews, Paul Quinn College; Michael Fisch; Michael Dylan Foster, Indiana U; Wendy Goldberg; Marc Hairston, U of Texas, Dallas; Charles Shiro Inouye, Tufts University; Rei Okamoto Inouye, Northeastern U; Paul Jackson; Seth Jacobowitz, San Francisco State U; Thomas Lamarre, McGill U; Tom Looser, New York U; Sheng-mei Ma, Michigan State U; Christine Marran, U of Minnesota; Zilia Papp, Hosei U, Tokyo; Marco Pellitteri; Timothy Perper; Yoji Sakate; Chinami Sango; Deborah Scally; Deborah Shamoon, U of Notre Dame; Manami Shima; Rebecca Suter, U of Sydney; Takayuki Tatsumi, Keio U, Tokyo; Christophe Thouny; Gavin Walker; Dennis Washburn, Dartmouth College; Teresa M.

Three armies march on New Prentisstown, each one intent on destroying the others. Todd and Viola are caught in the middle, with no chance of escape. As the battles commence, how can they hope to stop the fighting? How can there ever be peace when they&#39;re so hopelessly outnumbered? And if war makes monsters of men, what terrible choices await? But then a third voice breaks into the battle, one bent on revenge - the electrifying finale to the award-winning &#34;Chaos Walking&#34; trilogy, &#34;Monsters of Men&#34; is a heart-stopping novel about power, survival, and the devastating realities of war.</p><p>Patrick Ness is the author of The Knife of Never Letting Go and The Ask and the Answer - books one and two in the Chaos Walking trilogy - for which he has won numerous awards, including the Guardian Children&#39;s Fiction Prize and the Booktrust Teenage Prize.

In under two minutes, the Mayor had us up on horseback, Morpeth and Angharrad coming running from round the back of the ruins of the cathedral, and by the time we'd hopped up, stepping over the still unconshus bodies of the men who tried to help me overthrow the Mayor, there was the army taking messy shape in front of us.<br><br>Not all of it, tho, maybe less than half, the rest still stretched up along the southern road to the hill with the notch on it, the road to where the battle was sposed to be.<br><br>Angharrad's thinking and I can feel spikes of nerves all thru her body. She's scared nearly half to death. <br><br>So am I.<br><br>"BATTALIONS READY!" the Mayor shouts and immediately Mr. Hammar and the later-arriving Mr. Tate and Mr. O'Hare and Mr. Morgan snap salutes and the soldiers start lining up in the right formayshuns, twisting thru each other in coils and getting into order so quickly it almost hurts my eyes to watch it.<br><br>"I know," the Mayor says. "It's a thing of beauty, isn't it?" I point my rifle at him, the rifle I took from Davy. <br><br>"You just remember our agreement," I say. "Yer gonna keep Viola safe and you ain't gonna control me with yer Noise. You do that and you stay alive. That's the only reason I let you go."<br><br>His eyes flash. "You realize that means you can't let me out of your sight," he says, "even if you have to follow me into battle. Are you ready for that, Todd?"<br><br>"I'm ready," I say, even tho I ain't but I'm trying not to think about it.<br><br>"I have a feeling you'll do well," he says.<br><br>"Shut up," I say. "I beat you once, I'll beat you again." He grins. "Of that I have no doubt."<br><br>"THE MEN ARE READY, SIR!" Mr. Hammar shouts from his horse, saluting fiercely.<br><br>The Mayor keeps his eyes on me. "The men are ready, Todd," he says, his voice teasing. "Are you?"<br><br>"Just get on with it."<br><br>And his smile gets even wider. He turns to the men. "Two divisions down the western road for the first attack!" His voice snakes thru everyone's head again, like a sound you can't ignore. "Captain Hammar's division at the front, Captain Morgan taking the rear! Captains Tate and O'Hare will round up the rest of the men and armaments yet to arrive and join the fray with the greatest dispatch."<br><br>Armaments? I think.<br><br>"If the fight isn't already over by the time they join us-" The men laugh at this, a loud, nervous, aggressive kind of laugh.<br><br>"Then as a united army, we will drive the Spackle back up that hill and make them regret the day they were EVER BORN!"<br><br>And the men give a roaring cheer.<br><br>"Sir!" Captain Hammar shouts. "What about the army of the Answer, sir?"<br><br>"First we beat the Spackle," says the Mayor, "then the Answer will be child's play."<br>He looks across his army of men and back up the hill to the Spackle army, still marching down. Then he raises his fist and gives the loudest Noise shout of all, a shout that bores right down into the very center of every man hearing it.<br><br>"TO BATTLE!"<br><br>"TO BATTLE!" the army cries back at him and sets off at a fierce pace outta the square, racing toward the zigzag hill. The Mayor looks at me one last time, like he can barely keep from laughing at how much fun he's having. And with- out another word, he spurs Morpeth hard in the sides and they gallop into the square after the departing army.<br><br>The army heading off to war.<br> <br>Follow? Angharrad asks, fear coming off her like sweat.<br><br>"He's right," I say. "We can't let him out of our sight. He's got to keep his word. He's got to win his war. He's got to save her."<br><br>For her, Angharrad thinks.<br><br>For her, I think back, all my feeling about her behind it.

In <em>A Passion for My Provence </em> (previously published as <em>Chez Nous</em>), Lydie combines anecdotes of her time spent in Provence--the land of olive oil and garlic--with recipes she has acquired from three generations of French friends and family. The book begins with a tour of Lydie's restored ch�teau in the olive capital, Nyons, ending at the birthplace of many fabulous meals--her inviting kitchen. But Lydie's inspirations come from beyond her copper-potted enclave; she gathers wild herbs in the surrounding hills, buys fresh produce and meats from the village market, and collects the traditional country recipes of her neighbors. These recipes, cleverly adapted for American kitchens, reflect the joyous bounty of France. With relaxed guidance and eminent authority, Lydie Marshall combines French flair, style, thrift, and taste with American efficiency and concern for diet. Sample Lydie's recipes, and you will taste the honest, satisfying, and delicious cooking of rural France.</p><p><p>Lydie Marshall is the author of <strong>Soup of the Day</strong>, <strong>A Passion for My Provence</strong>, <strong>A Passion for Potatoes</strong>, <strong>Chez Nous</strong>, and <strong>Cooking with Lydie Marshall</strong>.

Beale &amp; the American West</h2><p>Book by Thompson, Gerald</p><p></p><h2>Rat Bastards: The Life and Times of South Boston&#39;s Most Honorable Irish Mobster</h2><p><p>You've met the Italian mob<br>in <em>The Godfather</em>, now welcome<br>to the real-life world of Irish<br>America's own murderous clan<br>of organized crime </p><p>The man who has remained silent for more than a decade finally speaks, revealing the gritty true story of his life inside the infamous South Boston Irish mob led by the elusive, Machiavellian kingpin Whitey Bulger, who to this day remains on the lam as one of the world's Ten Most Wanted criminals, second only to Osama bin Laden.</p><p>John "Red" Shea was a top lieutenant in the South Boston Irish mob, rising to this position at the age of twenty-one. Thus began his tutelage under the notorious Irish godfather James "Whitey" Bulger. An ice-cold enforcer with a legendary red-hot temper, Shea was a legend among his Southie peers in the 1980s. From the first delivery truck he robbed at thirteen to the start of his twelve-year federal sentence for drug trafficking at twenty-seven, Shea was a portrait in American crime -- a terror, brutal and ruthlessly ambitious. Drug dealer, loan shark, money launderer, and multimillion-dollar narcotics kingpin, Shea was at the pinnacle of power -- until the feds came knocking and eventually obliterated the legendary mob in a well-orchestrated sweep of arrests, fueled by insider tips to the FBI and DEA. </p><p>While Bulger's other top men turned informant to save their own hides, Shea alone kept his code of honor and his mouth shut -- loyalty that earned him a dozen years of hard time even as the man he was protecting turned out to be, himself, a rat. For in the end, in a remarkable show of betrayal, Bulger turned out to be the FBI's "main man" and top informant -- tipping off the feds for decades while still managing to operate one of the most murderous and profitable organized crime outfits of all time.</p><p><em>In Rat Bastards</em>, Shea brings that mysterious world and gritty urban Irish American street culture into sharp focus by telling his own story -- of his fatherless upbringing, his apprenticeship on the tough streets of Southie, and his love affair with trouble, boxing, and then the gangster life. In prose that is refreshingly honest, personal, and surprisingly tender, Shea tells his harrowing, unflinching, and unapologetic story. A man who did the crime, did the time, and held fast to the Irish code of silence, which he was raised to follow at any cost, Shea remains a man of honor and in doing so has become a living legend. One of the last of a dying breed, a true stand-up guy.</p><p>Shea expects no forgiveness and makes no excuses for the life he chose. His story is intense, compelling, and in your face.</p></p><p><p>John "Red" Shea, forty, completed his twelve-year federal prison sentence in 2002 and is now living on the right side of the law and working in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>Shea&#x2014;who at age 20 was the drug boss for South Boston Irish mobster James "Whitey" Bulger and later served 12 years in federal prison for drug trafficking (yes, he was given the opportunity to rat, but, "like a man," he didn't)&#x2014;gives gangster honor a bare-knuckled workout in his memoir, a slick read dripping with the underworld holy trinity of sex, drugs and violence. Born in 1965 into a "fucked up family" in South Boston, Shea traded a foundering boxing career for a gig making $4,000 a night selling cocaine and marijuana. Before long, Bulger took him under his wing and, being a tough and honorable guy, Shea ascended the ranks and had a crew working for him before he was busted and did his time. To hear Shea tell the story, he's about the only guy in South Boston who can keep his trap shut&#x2014;including Bulger, who turned rat and is now in hiding&#x2014;once the cuffs are on. And though his unrelenting swagger can wear thin and the writing has lackluster moments, Shea's story is a bawdy page-turner in the Iceman tradition that true crime fans will enjoy. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos.<i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Many of the 18 stories play with the scope that characterizes classic space opera. In Greg Egan's Glory, creatures embody themselves as aliens to perform archeological research, only to get caught up in a struggle between two worlds. Robert Reed's Hatch, limited in locale to the hull of a giant ship, proves that the scope of the struggle for life is always epic. Stephen Baxter's Remembrance walks a line between the personal and the global as resisters against Earth's conquerors remember one man's struggle against the alien invaders. Kage Baker's humorous Maelstrom, in which an acting troupe on frontier Mars puts on a Poe story for the miners there, tells a personal story in an epic setting. The new space opera teaches us that despite the bizarre turns humanity may take to conquer these outr� settings, a recognizable core of humanity remains. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She decides to go public with her disease despite fears about the backlash at work, and her bold choices in treatment are irreverent and uplifting. When her breast is under construction and her hair is falling out, her skirts get shorter. She goes to work every day and gets promoted. She has sex with her bandages on. She reinvents her beauty and in a bold move of conscious objection, forgoes the final phase of her breast reconstruction: the nipple. She is reborn in a tattoo parlor when she gets a heart tattoo where her nipple once was.<br> <br>Geralyn recovers from her mastectomy and chemo and has a baby in the same hospital where she was treated for cancer. What could have been a huge negative for this young cancer survivor became the impetus to examine her own sexuality and burgeoning womanhood. Virtually nothing has been written for women of a young age who have been diagnosed with breast cancer. This book also deals with the broader issue of self-acceptance that anyone grappling with questions of illness, self-image and sexuality can identify with.<br></p><p><p>This book is for any woman who has ever lost anything big.</p><p>"Isn't attitude everything?" &#x2013;<i>Good Housekeeping</i><br>"A bold memoir." &#x2013;<i>People</i></p><p>"Surprisingly optimistic and immensely empowering." &#x2013;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Geralyn Lucas makes you laugh and cry in the very same moment.....

Copies now feature in numerous important collections around the world, including New York&#x2019;s Museum of Modern Art, while legendary SUMO copy number one, autographed by over 100 of the book&#x2019;s featured celebrities, broke the record for the most expensive book published in the 20th century, selling at auction in Berlin on April 6, 2000, for 620,000 German marks &#x2013; approximately &#x20ac;317,000.</p><p>A decade on from its first appearance, the XL SUMO brings this unprecedented publishing venture to an even wider audience with a lighter but no less glamorous format. Carefully revised by June Newton, and with its own presentation bookstand, the book remains a spectacular tribute to the 20th century&#x2019;s most influential, intriguing, and controversial photographer, with hundreds of exquisite images, from his stunning fashion shoots to his shimmering nudes, provocative mise-en-sc�nes, and celebrity portraits.</p></p><p>Bringing an entirely new slant to the concept of the coffee-table book, <i>SUMO</i> is a suitably enormous homage to 79-year-old Helmut Newton, the master of subversive and erotic photography. "I wanted to build a monument to the most important photographer of the 20th century," comments Benedikt Taschen, the publisher behind <i>SUMO</i>. He delivers. Weighing over 65 pounds, measuring more than two feet long, and breaking any previous size record in book publishing, <i>SUMO</i> contains 480 pages of every aspect of Newton's outstanding career in photography. Each copy of the book is bound by hand and numbered and signed by the artist. In order to showcase this colossus, the book is packaged with its own stand designed by Philippe Starck. <p> This outsized volume contains the body of Newton's controversial yet iconographic work, documenting fashion, fetishism, and above all an overriding obsession with voyeurism that can make the viewer feel complicit or uneasy by turns. Newton himself describes <i>SUMO</i> as "terrifying and outrageous. I don't even look at it as a book.... I look at it as an object." <i>--Catherine Taylor, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>"HELMUT NEWTON'S SUMO WINS INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY'S 1999 INFINITY AWARD AT MAY 11 CEREMONY <p>Helmut Newton's SUMO published by TASCHEN has been judged the Best Book on Photography Published in 1999 by world-renowned International Center of Photography. </p><p>SUMO, the biggest and most costly book ever produced, was judged best in a field of outstanding photography books published in the last year of the 20th century. Conceived as a monumental tribute to Helmut Newton, arguably the most influential and controversial of contemporary photographers, SUMO has become a star in its own right by winning this honor in a field filled with worthy books devoted to photography."</p></p><h2>Rikugun: Volume 2 - Weapons of the Imperial Japanese Army &amp; Navy Ground Forces</h2><p>&#34;Rikugun: Guide to Japanese Ground Forces 1937-1945&#34; is the first nuts-and-bolts handbook to utilize both the voluminous raw allied intelligence documents and postwar Japanese documentation as primary sources. This second volume covers the armament of the ground forces. It takes advantage not only of postwar Japanese research, but also the extensive technical intelligence efforts of the Allies near the end of the war, and the postwar investigations that have heretofore generally been ignored to provide a complete examination of wartime Japanese armament. The book is divided into twenty-three sections covering all categories including not only the standard arms, such as machine guns and coast artillery, but also more esoteric items such as bridging, chemical weapons and assault equipment. Each section provides both production and technical data, as well as a discussion of the unique characteristics of each weapon and its place in the force structure, accompanied by over 300 photographs and numerous data tables.</p><p>Leland Ness has been conducting and supervising defense analysis and writing military history for over 40 years. He served as director of special projects at DMS/Jane&#39;s, published a newsletter on ground ordnance for the defense industry, and has been an e"this is the best reference on the subject I have seen to date.&nbsp; If you have any interest in the equipment used by the Japanese during WW2 then I suggest you check this one out.&nbsp; Well done to author Leland Ness for another excellent book to accompany his earlier Rikugun volume 1" (<i>Military Modelling</i>)</p><h2>A History of the End of the World: How the Most Controversial Book in the Bible Changed the Course of Western Civilization</h2><p><p></p><blockquote><em>"[The Book of] Revelation has served as a "language arsenal" in a great many of the social, cultural, and political conflicts in Western history. Again and again, Revelation has stirred some dangerous men and women to act out their own private apocalypses. Above all, the moral calculus of Revelation&#x2014;the demonization of one's enemies, the sanctification of revenge taking, and the notion that history must end in catastrophe&#x2014;can be detected in some of the worst atrocities and excesses of every age, including our own. For all of these reasons, the rest of us ignore the book of Revelation only at our impoverishment and, more to the point, at our own peril."</em></blockquote><p></p><p>The mysterious author of the Book of Revelation (or the Apocalypse, as the last book of the New Testament is also known) never considered that his sermon on the impending end times would last beyond his own life. In fact, he predicted that the destruction of the earth would be witnessed by his contemporaries. Yet Revelation not only outlived its creator; this vivid and violent revenge fantasy has played a significant role in the march of Western civilization. </p><p>Ever since Revelation was first preached as the revealed word of Jesus Christ, it has haunted and inspired hearers and readers alike. The mark of the beast, the Antichrist, 666, the Whore of Babylon, Armageddon, and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are just a few of the images, phrases, and codes that have burned their way into the fabric of our culture. The questions raised go straight to the heart of the human fear of death and obsession with the afterlife. Will we, individually or collectively, ride off to glory, or will we drown in hellfire for all eternity? As those who best manipulate this dark vision learned, which side we fall on is often a matter of life or death. Honed into a weapon in the ongoing culture wars between states, religions, and citizenry, Revelation has significantly altered the course of history. </p><p>Kirsch, whom the <em>Washington Post</em> calls "a fine storyteller with a flair for rendering ancient tales relevant and appealing to modern audiences," delivers a far-ranging, entertaining, and shocking history of this scandalous book, which was nearly cut from the New Testament. From the fall of the Roman Empire to the Black Death, the Inquisition to the Protestant Reformation, the New World to the rise of the Religious Right, this chronicle of the use and abuse of the Book of Revelation tells the tale of the unfolding of history and the hopes, fears, dreams, and nightmares of all humanity.</p></p><p><p>Jonathan Kirsch is the author of ten books, including the national bestseller <em>The Harlot by the Side of the Road</em> and his most recent work, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> bestseller <em>A History of the End of the World</em>. Kirsch is also a book columnist for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, a broadcaster for NPR affiliates in Southern California, and an adjunct professor at New York University.</p>The question of whether religions have historically done more harm or good is one of those debates that persist well beyond their proper sophomore-year expiration date. But there is a less futile variation on the argument: What is it in specific faith traditions that can lead to dangerous interpretations?<p>In the five years since 9/11, much time has been devoted to identifying the elements of Islam that lend themselves to a hateful jihadist ideology. Less has been devoted to what is incendiary in the other two Abrahamic traditions: Judaism and Christianity. Jonathan Kirsch, the author of several acclaimed books on religious themes, goes some way toward remedying that deficit in this thoughtful history and analysis of the most controversial book of the New Testament, the Book of Revelation.</p><p> A work so problematic that many early Church Fathers found it unfit for inclusion in the canon, it also troubled many later Christians. "There is one sufficient reason for the small esteem in which I hold it -- that Christ is neither taught in it nor recognized," wrote the great reformer Martin Luther. Even those Christians who made an uneasy truce with the book urged caution: St. Augustine, for example, warned against any literal interpretation of its symbol-strewn wordscape.</p><p>Unfortunately, Kirsch shows, Augustine's admonition has been honored more in the breach than in the observance. The book's notion of the imminent end of the world and its "phantasmagoria of words, numbers, colors, images, and incidents" describing the end-times have been employed in works of high art, as well as in some of the wilder fantasies and fulminations to issue from pulpits, religious tracts and popular fiction. The Antichrist, the Great Whore of Babylon, the Battle of Armageddon, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, the number 666: These have been picked up by zealots bent on any number of religious, political or cultural crusades, from the art-destroying Savanarola in 15th-century Florence to contemporary figures as different as the Waco cult leader David Koresh and the hectoring Moral Majoritarian Jerry Falwell. "Above all," writes Kirsch, "Revelation is now -- and has always been -- a potent rhetorical weapon in a certain kind of culture war, a war of contesting values and aspirations that has been waged throughout human history." </p><p>Although apocalyptic themes can be traced to the Zoroastrian religion of ancient Persia, it took the Hebrew idea of a God working through history to give the vision real purchase. Apocalyptic writing actually emerged rather late in the Hebrew tradition, though it borrowed from the earlier literature of prophecy. But instead of pointing to a future earthly kingdom under a god-anointed king, as the prophets had done, apocalyptic visionaries proposed an otherworldly paradise and offered a new explanation for evil in the world, elevating Satan from a mere tempter (Genesis) or accuser (Job) to the full-blown adversary of God and the source of all evil.</p><p>But what accounts for the emergence of apocalyptic writing? Part of the answer, Kirsch helpfully explains, is a culture war that erupted in Judea in the 4th century B.C. between strict Jews and those who had adopted the Hellenistic ways of their Greek conquerors -- ways that included participation in Greek athletic games. Finding the conspicuous hedonism of these Hellenized Jews repulsive, the other faction launched a moral crusade against it.</p><p>Another instigation to apocalypticism was an actual armed struggle that broke out in the 2nd century B.C., when the followers of Judah Maccabee revolted against a tyrannical Syrian despot, Antiochus, who was trying to eradicate Judaism from the land that the Syrians governed. To strengthen the Maccabeans' resolve, charismatic authors wove tales rich with strange visionary elements and the promise, Kirsch writes, of "a day of bloody revenge against their enemies." Only one apocalyptic tale found its way into the Hebrew Bible (the book of Daniel), but scores of others were produced throughout Judea. Those written during the decades preceding and following the life of Jesus, when the Romans tightened their rule over the rebellious province, gave new importance to the figure of the messiah, casting him not just as a mortal prince but also as a celestial savior.</p><p>So while Revelation, like many other New Testament books, contains what appear to be strongly anti-Semitic elements (including its rant against the "synagogue of Satan"), it grew directly out of a literary tradition associated with one important strain of pre-rabbinical Judaism. Indeed, the obvious Jewishness of the text is one reason that it gave pause to later Christian leaders. Where was the sweet emphasis upon love and forgiveness that comes through so strongly in the Gospels? Some scholars suggest that the core story of Revelation, minus certain superficial Christian additions, was written by someone who wasn't even a Christian.</p><p>But Revelation nonetheless was canonized as part of the New Testament, and Kirsch offers a thorough account of the intellectual and spiritual mischief that Revelation has spawned -- and also some of the good. Medieval Catholics used the book to justify the Crusades, support reform efforts and validate persecution of the Jews, while later Protestant reformers (including the same Luther who objected to Revelation) drew on its imagery to attack Catholicism and the papacy. "I do not know whether the pope himself be Antichrist or his apostle," Luther wrote, apparently without blushing. </p><p>Ironically, enthusiasm for Revelation was always stronger in western Christendom than in the eastern part of the Christian world where the text was produced. That irony proved most true, Kirsch shows, when Revelation made its way to the New World, where apocalyptic imagery was applied to practically every major development in American history, from the Puritan witch-hunt craze to the Civil War to any number of social and moral crusades in the 20th and 21st centuries. While apocalypticism has inspired progressive causes, including the civil rights vision of Martin Luther King Jr., it increasingly came to support a fundamentalist conception of a properly Christian society.</p><p>Apocalyptic notions are never scarier than when they creep into politics, as they did quite openly in the pronouncements of Ronald Reagan. "Apparently never in history have so many of the prophecies come true in such a relatively short time," the then-governor of California declared in 1968. And though Reagan learned to tone down such pronouncements as president, he never abandoned his belief in the approaching Armageddon.</p><p>If the current occupant of the White House "does not speak in the familiar vocabulary of apocalyptic fundamentalism," Kirsch writes, "it is mostly because a new and updated 'language arsenal' has been deployed in contemporary America" -- an arsenal that in this case, Kirsch explains, uses code phrases such as "intelligent design" and "culture of life." But many of the president's policies resonate powerfully with a large fundamentalist community that takes apocalyptic notions, including those that apply to Israel, with a fervent literalism. For them, and many others, the rapture draws nigh. </p><p>Reviewed by Jay Tolson <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post. All Rights Reserved.</p></p><h2>The Shred Power Cleanse: Eat Clean. Get Lean.

It was here, in 1938, that Hollywood's glamour girl, Victoria Frazer, drowned during a scandalous affair with actor Roger Brandt. Few knew about the baby spirited into the night. That baby was Lauren's mother. Just two years ago, Lauren's husband, returned to Lake Lure to film a documentary on Brandt, had himself died. Now Lauren has received a warning that her husband was murdered. Will she be next? The answers lie in the murky past, in the dark truths of a place shrouded in terrifying secrets . . . .<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>PHYLLIS A. WHITNEY (1903-2008) was born of American parents in Yokohama, Japan. She worked with books throughout her life as a librarian, bookseller, reviewer, writing teacher, and bestselling author. She was one of America&#39;s most successful writers of romance and suspense and in 1988 won the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America.In this (for Whitney) overly talky and cluttered mystery/suspense novel, set in a scenic area of western North Carolina, a young widow from California sets out to discover the true story of two deaths decades apart. Lauren Castle's late husband, filmmaker Jim, has been accidentally killed while working on a documentary concerning the career of fabled actor Roger Brandt, who still lives on beautiful Lake Lure. In 1938, the movie idol had made a film--as well as a child--with his lover, the lovely Victoria Fraser. The child was raised elsewhere, and Victoria, presumably distraught that Roger would stay forever with his wife, Camilla, committed suicide. Or did she? Lauren, meanwhile, has told no one except former boyfriend Gordon (now a forest ranger) that she is the granddaughter of Victoria and Roger. Now in North Carolina to sleuth, Lauren pinballs here and there, picking up bits of info and chatting with: blunt but chummy Gretchen Fraser, Victoria's sister; Gordon's mother Finella, who's heavily into making products from the kudzu vine; Natalie Brandt, Roger's daughter, an artist who has painted a spooky picture of a UFO-like object landing on the local mountain peak; Camilla, who introduces Lauren to Victoria's old dresser, Betty; and hirsute Ty, Gretchen's brother, who is mighty strange and beats drums in the wild. At the close, when all's made plain, there's a climb to what might be a sky-high grave. This time the story seems crowded, and Whitney has not allowed her mob of suspects space and time; readers may feel overwhelmed by the plethora of chat and surfeit of chatterers. But even the best of the pros can lob one into the underbrush--not that Whitney's following will care. (Literary Guild Dual Selection for Fall) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Most readers hold in their mind an idealized image of the novelist at work&#x2014;a figure in a trendy urban coffeehouse, a solitary figure walking along an empty beach. The truth, however, is seldom so romantic.</p> <p>Before going any further, let us stipulate that, much like the hero of my novels, the art restorer and spy Gabriel Allon, I am something of a creature of habit. I work seven days a week, from early in the morning until six thirty in the evening, when I stop to watch the evening news. My work clothing never varies: gray sweatpants by Russell Athletic, a long-sleeve T-shirt by L.L. Bean, fleece Acorn moccasins, and discount cotton socks from Marks &amp; Spencer in England. Occasionally, visitors to our house will catch a glimpse of this outfit, but, for the most part, my wife and children tend to shield me from public view. As a rule, I don&#x2019;t answer the telephone&#x2014;unless it is a family emergency of some sort&#x2014;and I don&#x2019;t read e-mail. I nibble rather than eat. <em>Portrait of a Spy</em>, like all the Gabriel Allon novels, was fueled largely by McVitie&#x2019;s digestive biscuits.</p> <p>I have a computer, of course, but I really do most of my actual <em>writing</em> in longhand, on yellow legal pads. I prefer to work while lying on the floor rather than at my desk. This annoys my wife because she took a great deal of time and effort to have a desk custom made to fit my office. When I showed her a photograph of Muriel Spark, one of her literary heroes, writing in longhand stretched across a floor, she was only partially mollified. Sometimes we talk about living somewhere other than Georgetown. Secretly, the very idea terrifies me. After writing 14 books in the same room of the same house, I am afraid I have lost the ability to work anywhere else.</p> <p>As for my writing instrument of choice, it is unquestionably the pencil. There is something about the sound it makes scratching across the page that, for me, is the essence of composition. The pencil is the antithesis of all things cyber and e, a means of returning, however briefly, to a world that is unconnected and unwired. A pad and pencil do not freeze or crash. There are no viruses or error messages. If a thunderstorm knocks out the power, the words will still be there when the lights come on again. And then, there is the satisfying natural rhythm of the work itself&#x2014;the turning of the completed page, the sharpening of the dulled point, the fortnightly disposal of the fluffy wooden shavings.</p> <p>Lately, I have been hoarding pencils. I&#x2019;m not sure precisely when it began; I suspect it had something to do with the death of the typewriter. An irrational fear gripped me, a fear that pencils were next. If the typewriter could go extinct, how could the lowly, environmentally hostile pencil possibly hope to survive in the brave new world? I now order my favorite brand&#x2014;the Paper Mate Mirado Black Warrior No. 2&#x2014;by the case. I am reasonably confident I now have enough pencils on hand to see me through the next several novels&#x2014;though, if I happen to misplace a pencil, I will search the house thoroughly before removing a new one from its special drawer and sharpening it for the first time. To sharpen a virgin pencil is, in a sense, to commit an act of assisted suicide. It saddens me.</p> <p>I wish it were not so. I wish I could write on a computer while traveling on an airplane or sitting in a strange hotel room, but I cannot. I have become a prisoner of my office. I need my floor, and my Mirado Black Warrior No. 2 pencils, and my McVitie&#x2019;s digestive biscuits. I hoard them, too. I keep them on a special shelf in the storage room, next to my socks from Marks &amp; Spencer.</p> <p>Copyright � Daniel Silva 2011.

That's what children chant when they are being teased; it's what their parents chanted, and probably their grandparents before them. Collected in this invaluable book are the wit and wisdom of generations of schoolchildren&#x2014;more than 170 selections ranging from insults and riddles to jeers and jump-rope rhymes. With Iona Opie's introduction and detailed notes and Maurice Sendak's remarkable pictures&#x2014;vignettes, sequences, and full-page paintings both wickedly funny and comically sad&#x2014;it offers knowledge and entertainment to all who open it.</p><p>"I saw Esau kissing Kate, / The fact is we all three saw; / For I saw him, / And he saw me, / And she saw I saw Esau." So goes the schoolyard chant that graces this brilliant collection with its title. This "Schoolchild's Pocket Book," edited by lore and literature legends Iona and Peter Opie and gleefully illustrated by Maurice Sendak, definitely belongs on every child's shelf, right next to Mother Goose nursery rhymes and Grimms' fairy tales. <i>I Saw Esau</i> was first published in Great Britain in 1947, but it is vibrantly alive today as a glorious, whimsical collection of more than 170 schoolyard rhymes, ranging from insults and riddles to tongue twisters, jeers, and jump-rope rhymes--"clearly not rhymes that a grandmother might sing to a grandchild on her knee," writes Iona Opie in her introduction. We adore this sturdy, beautifully designed, pocket-sized book of funny, sometimes twisted, but always perfectly illustrated morsels of schoolyard tradition and history. <i>(Ages 4 to 8, and all other ages, too)</i><b>Iona and Peter Opie</b> were married in 1943 and worked together for nearly forty years, studying and writing about children&#x2019;s lore and literature until Peter&#x2019;s death in 1982.

Scenes with Zen teachers and the author's two vividly exuberant older parents, illustrate how the author adapts mindfulness techniques for the busyness of her life, without losing her edge. With honest and vivid stories about dealing with difficult relationships with family members, death, illness, vanity, exhaustion, and creating a safety net of joy, the author explores and offers guidance for how to find inspiration and nourishment amid the juggle and rush of daily life.<br><br>This book is designed for adults who are new to mindfulness practice, curious skeptics and critics,&nbsp; new and experienced parents, and and anyone interested in finding greater joy, nourishment, and a larger community in their lives.</p><p>Rachel Neumann is a Bay Area-based writer whose work focuses on civil liberties, human rights, mindfulness, and the intersection of parenting and progressive politics.

One of their settlements, rediscovered in the 19th Century, is a unique archaeological find and the focus of this study. Skara Brae, literally the "village of the hilly dunes," housed a community of people for approximately 700 years. Because of the shortage of trees, the homes and furniture were built entirely of stone. A violent storm buried Skara Brae intact around 2400 b.c. , and its inhabitants abandoned it. In 1850 a.d. , another storm exposed its walls. Subsequent archaeological studies leave many questions unanswered. For example, the crude pottery is a puzzling contrast to the sophisticated building methods. Dunrea, who has made four visits to Skara Brae, uses a straightforward descriptive style and is careful to point out the few speculations which are based on finds at neighboring sites. The emphasis is on the structures themselves, not on possible activities of the inhabitants. Technical vocabulary is defined as it is used. Attractive pen-and-ink wash drawings, meticulously detailed, enhance and clarify each of the 36 pages. The well-preserved site of Skara Brae offers a tantalizing glimpse at man's distant past. Childrenand adultsare sure to be intrigued. Marguerite F. Raybould, Glendale Public Library, Calif.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.The author introduces a little-known archeological wonder: the ancient village of Skara Brae. In 1850, a storm blew across the Orkney Islands north of Scotland, exposing a small part of a primitive village. Over the next 125 years, the settlement was uncovered piece by piece and preserved. Skara Brae was first settled over 5000 years ago, when a small band of farmers and herders found the land good for building and grazing. The village's gradual evolution is revealed as readers see the changing ceremonial practices, burial methods and the design of the stone huts, which became larger and more comfortable. In 2400 B.C. a storm buried Skara Brae, and the villagers abandoned it. The items they dropped as they fled lay there for centuries. Dunrea's clear drawings put Skara Brae into focus for every reader; he delivers not only the engrossing tale of an ancient lifestyle, but a vivid story of an archeological search. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Point Man: Inside the Toughest and Most Deadly Unit in Vietnam by a Founding Member of the Elite Navy Seals</h2><p>A member of the U.S. Navy SEAL Team II describes his experiences in Vietnam</p><p><p>Kevin Dockery is the military historian and field curator for the UDT/SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida. He lives in Michigan.</p>A veteran's salty recollections of what it meant to be a member of the Navy SEALs. Following repeated requests, Watson (whose 1955 enlistment was prompted by a 1952 film, The Frogman) was finally picked for Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) training in 1959. Having survived an ultrademanding regimen that washes out approximately nine of every ten volunteers, the author (by then a senior petty officer) was assigned to the first SEAL (sea, air, land) unit. Watson went on to three combat tours in Vietnam, where he served under the hard-nosed Richard Marcinko (Rogue Warrior, 1992). Here, with an assist from Dockery (Seals in Action, a 1991 paperback), the shotgun-toting author (who invariably took the point on behind-the- lines missions even after he was promoted to chief) offers vivid accounts of his platoon's operations, which ranged from patrolling rivers through interdicting enemy supply lines, liberating POWs, and kidnapping Communist officials. With evident relish, the highly decorated Watson offers brutally candid commentary on the merits of #4 buckshot (which ``would knock down any gook I aimed at...''); indigenous allies (too many of whom, he says, ``were like their flag--what wasn't Red was yellow''); rear-echelon commanders; and a host of other still sore subjects. Nor has his postretirement position as curator of the UDT/SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida, mellowed Watson. Toward the end of his unsparing narrative, he asserts: ``The Americans and South Vietnamese may have lost the Vietnam War. But the SEALs won their part....'' An unreconstructedly bad dude's testament to the rewards and risks of going in harm's way.

The high-pressure world we live in, with its emphasis on material goods, has eclipsed the timeless values of commitment and spirituality. Today success is measured not by what we are, but by what we possess: the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, the trinkets we buy. <p> As a result, more and more people live with self-doubt, depression, ennui, and familial dysfunction. Relationships are stalled. Personal growth seems unattainable. In the end, the things we buy offer us no comfort. We grow old, lonely, and afraid, wondering how we could have done it differently. </p><p> <em>The Committed Life</em> teaches us a better way. Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis has been reaching out to people and helping others find happiness her entire life. By age six she was smuggling food and messages into Nazi detention camps during World War II, thereby learning her first lesson of the Torah: "You shall not stand idly by while the life of your brother is in jeopardy." Today she is a dynamic and inspiring leader who has devoted her life to combating the spiritual wasteland surrounding us. </p><p> The Rebbetzin knows that many of us are in trouble. She has heard countless cries for help escaping the emotional vacuums that have become our lives. Twenty-five years ago, she founded Hineni (Hebrew for "Here I am"), an outreach organization that has ignited the hearts and minds of people throughout the world. Her popular classes, based on the teachings of the Torah and focused on what is truly important in life, draw thousands every week. </p><p> Filled with wisdom as timeless as the Torah itself, <em>The Committed Life</em> is for anyone eager to connect with ancient wellsprings of faith. Each chapter offers its own riveting lesson on such pivotal subjects as responsibility, forgiving, banishing fear, gratitude, anger, commitment to marriage, depression, faith, and hope. This is a book that you will want to keep on your bookshelf and pick up again and again for help dealing with the many restrictions of daily living. </p><p> Written with the Rebbetzin's rare combination of honesty, love, and chutzpah, the stories here are universal and yet so deeply personal that reading them is like having her speak to you in your own home. This inspirational guide will give you the sustenance you need to lead a more fulfilling and committed life. </p><p> Drawing on the timeless wisdom of the Torah, Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis reminds us of the principles necessary for living a better and more committed life: </p><p></p><ul><li>Commitment <p></p></li><li> Inviting G-D Into Your Life Responsibility/Accountability Charity--Tzedukah <p></p></li><li> Prayer <p></p></li><li> Forgiveness Banishing Fear<p></p></li><li> Compassion <p></p></li><li> Faith <p></p></li><li> Hope Gratitude <p></p></li><li>Time <p></p></li><li>Gaining Control Over Yourself <p></p></li><li>Committing To Marriage the Sabbath <p></p></li><li>Creating A Family the Legacy Of Grandparents</li></ul><p></p><blockquote>"A Long Life is not good enough, but a good life is long enough." <p>"Let me share with you the formula our sages proposed for change and personal growth. `A man,' they teach, `is shaped by his <em>deeds</em> and <em>actions</em>' [<em>Sefer Ha Chinuch</em>, The Book of Education]. Now this may not sound like such a revolutionary idea, but it is diametrically opposed to that which our secular world believes--that it is our thoughts and convictions that mold and make us what we are...The mind is tricky, capable of rationalizing, playing games with ideas that the heart finds too demanding or too restrictive, and so <em>Sefer Ha Chinuch</em> advises us to bypass the cerebral, concentrate on our deeds and actions, and just do what we have to do. Through that doing, our personalities, our character traits, will be reshaped and molded until one day we will discover that we have become the new beings that we had hoped to become, that we are connecting to that goodness in our souls, and that we are on our way to fulfilling our mission in life."<br>-- from <em>The Committed Life</em></p></blockquote></p><p>Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis was born in Hungary and is descended from a great rabbinic dynasty that traces its lineage back to King David. Founder and president of Hineni, an international out-reach organization with centers in New York and Jerusalem, she writes a weekly column for the <em>Jewish Press</em>, has a weekly television program, lectures extensively, and has been featured in numerous national publications, among them <em>The New York Times, Newsweek, Time, </em>and <em>People</em>. She lives in New York.Jungreis warns us in her introduction that our generation lacks moral underpinnings, values, and role models, that our homes lack stability and serenity, that our families have become dysfunctional, and that our world is high on bitterness and low on kindness and generosity. The author's father was the chief Orthodox rabbi of Szeged, Hungary, and when the Nazis occupied that city during World War II, the family was taken to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. In the form of stories based on real-life incidents--including this harrowing family event--Jungreis advises readers on such weighty matters as commitment, responsibility, charity, peace, prayer, forgiveness, banishing fear, compassion, faith, hope, and gratitude. Jungreis, a Jew, quotes from the Torah and the Talmud, but her message is universal. <i>George Cohen</i></p><h2>Painting the Many Moods of Light</h2><p>A compendium of techniques for capturing light&#39;s evocative power and emotion in paint, provided by nine artists.</p><p></p><h2>Portrait of a Nude Woman As Cleopatra</h2><p>A series of poems offers a fresh perspective on the story of Antony and Cleopatra</p><p></p><h2>The Vocabulary of Science</h2><p>Designed to provide a concise reference source for the person with a neglected scientific background</p><p>Text: English, Greek, Latin</p><h2>Marriages of Isle of Wight County, Virginia, 1628-1800 : With a New Index</h2><p>The marriages in this work are founded upon the records of the ancient shire of Isle of Wight and include marriages from the area of present-day Southampton County, erected from Isle of Wight in 1749.

Raised by her regal and ambitious grandmother Paulina del Valle, Aurora grows up in a privileged environment, but is tormented by horrible nightmares. When she is forced to recognize her betrayal at the hands of the man she loves, and to cope with the resulting solitude, she explores the mystery of her past. </p></p><p>Isabel Allende has established herself as one of the most consummate of all modern storytellers, a reputation that is confirmed in her novel <i>Portrait in Sepia</i>. Allende offers a compelling saga of the turbulent history, lives, and loves of late 19th-century Chile, drawing on characters from her earlier novels, <i>The House of Spirits</i> and <i>Daughter of Fortune</i>.<p> In typical Allende fashion, <i>Portrait in Sepia</i> is crammed with love, desire, tragedy, and dark family secrets, all played out against the dramatic backdrop of revolutionary Chile. Our heroine Aurora del Valle's mother is a Chilean-Chinese beauty, while her father is a dissolute scion of the wealthy and powerful del Valle family. At the heart of Aurora's slow, painful re-creation of her childhood towers one of Allende's greatest fictional creations, the heroine's grandmother, Paulina del Valle. An "astute, bewigged Amazon with a gluttonous appetite," Paulina holds both the del Valle family and Allende's novel together as she presides over Aurora's adolescence in a haze of pastries, taffeta, and overweening love.</p><p> One of the most interesting aspects of the novel is Allende's decision to turn her heroine into a photographer: "through photography and the written word I try desperately to conquer the transitory nature of my existence, to trap moments before they evanesce, to untangle the confusion of my past." There is little confusion in Allende's elegantly crafted and hugely enjoyable novel. <i>--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p>Internationally celebrated novelist Isabel Allende has written a magnificent historical novel set at the end of the nineteenth century in Chile -- a marvelous family saga that takes up and continues the story begun in her highly acclaimed Daughter of Fortune.</p><p>Recounted in the voice of a young woman in search of her roots, <em>Portrait in Sepia</em> is a novel about memory and family secrets. Aurora del Valle suffers a brutal trauma that shapes her character and erases from her mind all recollection of the first five years of her life. Raised by her ambitious grandmother, the regal and commanding Paulina del Valle, Aurora grows up in a privileged environment, free of the limitations that circumscribe the lives of women at that time, but tormented by horrible nightmares. When she is forced to recognize her betrayal at the hands of the man she loves, and to cope with the resulting solitude, she decides to explore the mystery of her past.</p><p><em>Portrait in Sepia</em> is an extraordinary achievement: richly detailed, epic in scope, intimate in its probing of human character, and thrilling in the way it illuminates the complexity of family ties.</p></p><h2>Yehudi Menuhin: A Life</h2><p>Describes how Menuhin, the highest paid artist in the pre-war era, became a devotee of yoga, formed associations with Indian musician Ravi Sankar, developed a second career as a conductor, and created an international school that bears his name.</p><p>Humphrey Burton is a distinguished television director and commentator who was twice in charge of Music and Arts for BBC Television. A founding member of London Weekend Television, he is artistic director for the Barbican Centre and author of the highly acclaimed Leonard Bernstein. He has won many international awards, including three from the British Academy, four Emmys, and the Italia Prize (for The Making of West Side Story). Burton worked with Yehudi Menuhin on a twenty-part radio series for Classic FM.Menuhin, who began as one of the most remarkable child prodigies since Mozart and, over his 83 years (1916- 1999), became a kind of musical elder statesman, has found his ideal biographer in Burton. The veteran BBC director and producer, who also wrote the best book to date about Leonard Bernstein a few years back, is friendly and fair, with a wry appreciation of Menuhin's comic aspects. Burton does a better job sorting out the chronology and the reality of Menuhin's spectacular boyhood successes than the violinist himself did in his eloquent memoir Unfinished Journey. Although his early successes were in San Francisco, Menuhin was born in the Bronx to &#x201a;migr&#x201a; Russian-Jewish parents who realized early their boy was a genius and seemed always in a quandary about how far his talent should be exploited. From the mid-1920s to the outbreak of WWII, Menuhin was one of the preeminent international virtuosos, though after the war many critics believe that his playing deteriorated. (Burton disputes this opinion, writing that there is no evidence of the violinist's decline until the 1970s.) Music was only one of Menuhin's passions, however. He was among the first in the West to espouse yoga and the principles of organic food; he established a notable school for young musicians; he became involved in high-level diplomatic maneuverings for UNESCO and in the Arab-Israeli dispute; and eventually he took up conducting. Burton relays these accomplishments with winning humor and a scrupulous attention to detail that should please musical scholars; the only flaw is the absence of a discography.

While male artists exalted Woman's otherness in fetishized images, women artists explored their own subjective worlds. The self-images of Claude Cahun, Dorothea Tanning, Leonora Carrington, Frida Kahlo, Meret Oppenheim, Remedios Varo, Kay Sage, and others both internalize and challenge conventions for representing femininity, the female body, and female subjectivity. Many of the representational strategies employed by these pioneers continue to resonate in the work of contemporary women artists. The words "Surrealist" and "surrealism" appear frequently in discussions of such contemporary artists as Louise Bourgeois, Ana Mendieta, Cindy Sherman, Francesca Woodman, Kiki Smith, Dorothy Cross, Michiko Kon, and Paula Santiago.This book, which accompanies an exhibition organized by the MIT List Visual Arts Center, explores specific aspects of the relationship between historic and contemporary work in the context of Surrealism. The contributors reexamine art historical assumptions about gender, identity, and intergenerational legacies within modernist and postmodernist frameworks. Questions raised include: how did women in both groups draw from their experiences of gender and sexuality? What do contemporary artistic practices involving the use of body images owe to the earlier examples of both female and male Surrealists? What is the relationship between self-image and self- knowledge?Contributors : Dawn Ades, Whitney Chadwick, Salomon Grimberg, Katy Kline, Helaine Posner, Susan Rubin Suleiman, Dickran Tashjian.</p></p><p>Whitney Chadwick is Professor of Art at San Francisco State University. Her books include <i>Myth in Surrealist Painting</i> (1980) and <i>Women Artists and the Surrealist Movement</i> (1985).Seven essays are published here, one contributed by Chadwick herself, a well-known specialist on women artists who were part of the surrealist movement. The resulting anthology, which serves as a catalog to an exhibition traveling from fall 1998 through early 1999, is a fairly comprehensive look at the self-portraiture of contemporary women using feminist critical theory. The essayists find strong links between modernist historical Surrealism and contemporary women artists while highlighting the strategies of "displacement, doubling, fragmentation, and fetishizing of the baby" that frequently appear in works by Cindy Sherman, Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois, Dorothy Cross, and Ana Mendieta, among others. Of widest interest are the essays on Marcel Duchamp/Rose Selavy, Claude Cahun, and Cindy Sherman and Frida Kahlo.

They&#x2019;ll just need to watch their steps, as these ladies are liable to get mired in a very swampy mystery...<br><br><b>INCLUDES DELICIOUS RECIPES</b></p><p><b>Jacklyn Brady </b>is the author of the National Bestselling Piece of Cake Mysteries, set in New Orleans:<i> A Sheetcake Named Desire, Cake on a Hot Tin Roof, Arsenic and Old Cake, </i>and <i>The Cakes of Wrath.</i><p></p><p>One</p><p>&#x201c;<i>You need to tell her</i>,&#x201d; the voice inside my head whispered. It&#x2019;s an annoying voice, so despite the fact that my aunt had raised me to listen when my conscience voiced an opinion, I did my best to ignore it. It isn&#x2019;t <i>always</i> right, and besides, I was pretty sure Aunt Yolanda hadn&#x2019;t counted on me having to deliver bad news to Frances Mae Renier when she gave me that advice.</p><p>Frances Mae, known by most as Miss Frankie, is my mother-in-law (which explains why Aunt Yolanda didn&#x2019;t know about her when I was a kid). She&#x2019;s also my business partner. Together we run Zydeco Cakes, a high-end bakery near New Orleans&#x2019;s Garden District. Actually, I do much of the running. Miss Frankie is my mostly silent partner who does behind-the-scenes stuff like writing checks and nudging high-profile clients our way.</p><p>My name is Rita Lucero, and I want to say up front that, despite my hesitation to come clean with Miss Frankie, I am <i>not</i> a coward. I <i>am</i> a trained pastry chef who moved from Albuquerque to New Orleans just like <i>that</i> last summer when Miss Frankie offered me the chance to take over the day-to-day operations at Zydeco after the death of her son, Philippe, my almost-ex-husband. I&#x2019;d had to stand up to Uncle Nestor to do it, too. Believe me, that took courage.</p><p>My complicated relationship with Miss Frankie is why I was parking the Mercedes I&#x2019;d inherited from Philippe&#x2019;s estate in her driveway on a Friday night. I should have been joining the rest of Zydeco&#x2019;s staff for a birthday party at the Dizzy Duke, our favorite after-hours hangout. But Miss Frankie had summoned me, so here I was. I didn&#x2019;t know what she wanted, but that wasn&#x2019;t unusual. Still, I was feeling a little resentful as I climbed the front steps and rang her doorbell.</p><p>A stiff wind tossed the branches of the massive trees that lined the street. Their shadows did a macabre dance suitable for the Halloween season on Miss Frankie&#x2019;s sweeping front lawn, and I smiled as I watched them shift and bend.</p><p>Halloween is one of my favorite holidays. Not because I&#x2019;m overly fond of ghosts and goblins, but because I have sweet memories of trick-or-treating with my parents when I was young. They died in a car accident the year I turned twelve. I&#x2019;ve lost too many memories of them over the years so I cling to the ones I&#x2019;ve managed to keep. Losing them flipped my world upside down for a while, so I knew how much losing her only child had rocked Miss Frankie&#x2019;s. I do my best to be gentle with her, which is why I was hesitating over telling her that I&#x2019;d be going to Albuquerque for Christmas. We&#x2019;d limped through the holidays last year, mostly ignoring the festivities and staying home rather than joining others. She tries hard not to be clingy where I&#x2019;m concerned, and some days she succeeds. Others, she hangs on to me like a good-quality plastic wrap.</p><p>Miss Frankie was well aware that I had missed home since I&#x2019;d moved to New Orleans. She knew that, with the exception of one brief visit from Aunt Yolanda and Uncle Nestor, I hadn&#x2019;t seen my family in over a year. I&#x2019;d left my familiar Hispanic culture behind and stepped into the very different world of New Orleans, and sometimes homesickness hit hard. Surely Miss Frankie would understand why I wanted to go back for Christmas. At least she&#x2019;d try to.</p><p>I heard footsteps on the other side of the door, and an instant later it flew open. Miss Frankie greeted me with a warm hug and a glimmer of excitement in her golden brown eyes. In spite of the late hour, she looked ready to begin her day. Her auburn hair was teased and sprayed, a whiff of Shalimar noticeable as she wrapped her arms around me. She wore a pair of wide-legged pants and a loose-fitting tunic made of silky rust-colored fabric. A pair of off-white sandals revealed toenails painted a deep pumpkin color to match her fingernails.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for coming, sugar. Let&#x2019;s talk in the kitchen. I&#x2019;ve got everything in there.&#x201d;</p><p>I wondered what &#x201c;everything&#x201d; was, but I knew there was only one way to find out. After closing the door behind me, I followed her to the back of the house. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stay long,&#x201d; I warned as we walked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m meeting the rest of the staff at the Duke in half an hour to celebrate Dwight&#x2019;s birthday.&#x201d;</p><p>Dwight is one of Zydeco&#x2019;s best cake artists and an old friend from pastry school. He&#x2019;d come to New Orleans to work for Philippe, but he&#x2019;d been supportive of me since Philippe died and I took over at Zydeco. I wanted to show him that I could be a good friend, too.</p><p>I was even looking forward to the party, which I considered progress since I&#x2019;m not much of a partier. When Philippe and I were married, I was much more likely to be found balancing the books while he entertained our friends. Since stepping into his shoes at Zydeco, I&#x2019;d been making an effort to loosen up.</p><p>Miss Frankie glanced back at me. &#x201c;Is that tonight? I guess I plumb forgot about it. But don&#x2019;t worry. This won&#x2019;t take but a minute.&#x201d; She stopped just inside the kitchen and motioned me toward the table, which was piled with magazines, recipe books, newspaper clippings, and a large three-ring binder&#x2014;the kind she used whenever she coordinated a social event. It&#x2019;s her favorite thing to do.</p><p>&#x201c;It looks like you&#x2019;ve been busy,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Are you planning a party?&#x201d;</p><p>She grinned and headed for the coffeemaker. &#x201c;Not exactly.&#x201d; She turned back to me and linked her hands together over her chest. &#x201c;Oh, sugar, isn&#x2019;t it exciting? I decided to take Pearl Lee&#x2019;s advice.&#x201d;</p><p>I knew right then that we were in for trouble. Pearl Lee Gates is Miss Frankie&#x2019;s cousin, five foot nothing of &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see how much I can get away with.&#x201d; She&#x2019;s a few years younger than Miss Frankie, which puts her somewhere in her late fifties or early sixties, I think. Talking to her is dangerous enough. Taking her advice could be a disaster. You&#x2019;d think Miss Frankie would know that by now.</p><p>&#x201c;What advice is that?&#x201d; I asked. I thought I sounded remarkably calm, considering.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, about Christmas, of course. It&#x2019;s only two months away.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Uh-oh</i>. I got a squidgy feeling in my stomach, and my conscience gave me a sharp poke. This was the perfect time to tell Miss Frankie about my plans. And I probably would have if she hadn&#x2019;t kept talking.</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking about giving it a miss again this year. The thought of sitting around while people talk about Philippe&#x2014;and you know they will&#x2014;is just too much. It&#x2019;s barely been more than a year since he died and people think I should be through grieving. But we both know it doesn&#x2019;t ever really end.&#x201d;</p><p>We&#x2019;d just stepped onto uneven ground so I thought about my response before I spoke. I didn&#x2019;t have any experience with losing a child, but I did know how easy it was to get stuck in the moment of a loved one&#x2019;s death. I didn&#x2019;t want that for Miss Frankie, and I knew Philippe wouldn&#x2019;t have wanted it either. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t end,&#x201d; I agreed cautiously, &#x201c;but it does change with time. I still miss my parents, but the thought of them doesn&#x2019;t hurt like it used to.&#x201d;</p><p>My conscience flicked me again, but Miss Frankie was staring at me with eyes that were too bright and a smile that looked too brittle. She tried so hard to cope with the death of her only child but I could tell that she was on the edge of tears, so I swallowed my news and smiled instead. &#x201c;So does this mean you&#x2019;re going to join your family this year?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s wonderful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s better than that,&#x201d; she said, waving me toward a chair. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re <i>hosting</i> this year.&#x201d;</p><p>I think I gasped. I was all for Miss Frankie taking a step forward this year, but hosting? What was she thinking?</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re doing what?&#x201d; I squeaked.</p><p>&#x201c;Hosting the family. They&#x2019;ll all come here this year.&#x201d;</p><p>If Pearl Lee had been in the room, I might have throttled her right then and there. In Miss Frankie&#x2013;speak, <i>family</i> meant a dozen cousins from the Dumond family line along with their spouses and any children or grandchildren who had no other plans. Throw in a couple of ancient aunts and uncles and a Renier relative or two at loose ends, and she could be looking at fifty mouths or more to feed.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a huge job,&#x201d; I pointed out in case she&#x2019;d failed to do the math. &#x201c;Are you sure that&#x2019;s what you want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, of course, it&#x2019;s far too big a job to do alone. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m counting on your help. I&#x2019;ll admit that when Pearl Lee first suggested it, I thought it would be too, <i>too</i> much, but then she pointed out that by inviting everyone here, we&#x2019;ll be able to set the tone for the holiday week and maintain some kind of control over the events. It&#x2019;s my turn anyway, so I really should just jump in and do it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I&#x2014;&#x201d; I sank into the closest chair and tried not to sound angry. That wasn&#x2019;t easy. Miss Frankie has a habit of volunteering me for things without talking to me first. It&#x2019;s one of the few downsides of our relationship. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure everyone would understand if you wanted to wait another year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t want to wait. That&#x2019;s the point.&#x201d;</p><p>I knew that Pearl Lee was responsible for Miss Frankie&#x2019;s attitude, and that irritated me big-time. Pearl Lee has her fair share of problems, but Miss Frankie is fiercely loyal. I&#x2019;d learned not to bad-mouth her cousin in front of her, so again I went with a careful answer. &#x201c;Pearl Lee might have a point,&#x201d; I said with caution. &#x201c;But wouldn&#x2019;t you rather put your heads together and do this with her?&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Frankie waved a dismissive hand. &#x201c;Pearl Lee is useless when it comes to things like this. I need your head, sugar. I&#x2019;ve been thinking that if you make some amazing cake for the family, they&#x2019;ll see that the bakery is in good hands and we&#x2019;ll be able to focus on the future instead of the past.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but&#x2014;&#x201d; Hearing her talk about moving on was a good sign, even if her chosen method for doing it was questionable. I took another deep breath to steady my nerves. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t keep making commitments for me without talking to me first. What if I had other plans?&#x201d; Okay, so it wasn&#x2019;t the direct approach, but it was the best I could do with the threat of my mother-in-law&#x2019;s tears so close to the surface. When it comes to Miss Frankie, it&#x2019;s more effective to steal a few bases at a time than to try for a home run right off.</p><p>Her expression fell, but she looked concerned for only a moment. &#x201c;<i>Have</i> you made plans? Gracious! I never even thought. Well, that&#x2019;s no problem. You&#x2019;ll just invite whoever it is to join us here. After all, the more the merrier. Is it one of your young men?&#x201d;</p><p>By that, she meant Liam Sullivan, a detective with the New Orleans PD&#x2019;s Homicide Division, and Gabriel Broussard, part-owner of the Dizzy Duke. I&#x2019;d been seeing both of them over the past year&#x2014;all open and aboveboard&#x2014;but neither relationship had progressed to the &#x201c;spend holidays together&#x201d; stage.</p><p>I screwed up my courage, ready to tell Miss Frankie about Albuquerque, but she didn&#x2019;t wait for an answer. She waved a hand at the mess on the table. &#x201c;We can work all of that out later. That isn&#x2019;t what I wanted to talk to you about anyway. I have the most wonderful news for Zydeco, and I simply couldn&#x2019;t wait to tell you. How would you feel about making a cake for the Crescent City Vintage Clothing Society Belle Lune Ball?&#x201d;</p><p>Every thought inside my head froze and my heart began to thump. The Crescent City Vintage Clothing Society was one of the most prestigious groups in New Orleans. The Belle Lune Ball, held each January, was a premiere social event. The moneyed set shelled out staggering amounts of cash for tickets every year, and the silent auction brought in a whopping total that was used to help disadvantaged women around the world.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you kidding me?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;We actually have a shot?&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Frankie smiled slyly. &#x201c;You like the idea?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>yeah!</i> It&#x2019;s only one of the biggest events in the whole city. Do you know what a coup like that would do for our reputation?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have a good idea. That&#x2019;s why, when I heard that the society had an opening, I invited Evangeline Delahunt to lunch. She&#x2019;s eager to find someone quickly. For an event that size, time is running out. I saw an opportunity to get your work in front of the right people and I took it.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Uuurch!</i> My excitement ground to a screeching halt. &#x201c;Wait a minute. You&#x2019;re not talking about <i>this</i> year&#x2019;s ball? The one just three months away&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are you? With the holidays and everything, it&#x2019;s going to be tough to come up with a design, coordinate everything, and put together the kind of cake they&#x2019;d want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&#x2019;s a little more than just the cake, sugar. Actually, she needs a caterer for the entire event.&#x201d; Miss Frankie flicked her wrist as if catering dinner for a few hundred people would add barely any extra work. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, though. I have faith in you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But Zydeco doesn&#x2019;t <i>do</i> catering,&#x201d; I pointed out in what I hoped was a reasonable tone. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve never done catering.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t mean you can&#x2019;t do it. You&#x2019;ve had training, and I know Ox and Dwight have, too. Really, Rita, I&#x2019;m offering you the chance of a lifetime. But if you really don&#x2019;t want to do it, I&#x2019;ll call Evangeline and tell her to look for someone else. She&#x2019;ll be disappointed, but I&#x2019;m sure she won&#x2019;t hold it against you.&#x201d;</p><p>I kneaded my forehead and tried to pull my thoughts together. &#x201c;Why did she wait so long to find a caterer? Surely she knows what a huge job this is.&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Frankie waved her hand again. &#x201c;Well, of course she knows. She&#x2019;s been in charge of planning the ball for at least a decade. This is a great opportunity for Zydeco and for everyone who works there. There will be press coverage of the event, and there&#x2019;s a very good chance you&#x2019;ll be interviewed yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But we don&#x2019;t <i>do</i> catering,&#x201d; I reminded her again. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want Zydeco to gain a reputation as a caterer. I want it to be known as New Orleans&#x2019;s premiere bakery for high-end cakes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And it will be, after you do this job.&#x201d; Miss Frankie gave me a look that clearly said she thought I was being a bit slow on the uptake. &#x201c;Philippe tried more than once to get his foot in the door with Evangeline Delahunt. He never could do it.&#x201d;</p><p>That made my ears perk up. Philippe and I had met in pastry school, and at least in the beginning, we&#x2019;d indulged in what I thought was a healthy and harmless competition, pitting our cake decorating and business skills against each other whenever the occasion arose. Looking back, I could see now that before we&#x2019;d separated, the competition had become less healthy, but I hadn&#x2019;t realized it at the time.</p><p>Hearing about Philippe&#x2019;s failure to land the contract I&#x2019;d just been handed made my competitive side yawn and stretch like a cat waking up after a long nap. I tried again to get an answer to my question. &#x201c;If working for Evangeline Delahunt is such a <i>coup de gr�ce,</i> why is she looking for a caterer at this late date?&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Frankie&#x2019;s gaze flickered ever so slightly, which set off a warning bell in my head. &#x201c;She had to let the first one go. Something about them failing to produce an appropriate design and menu. I could have told her she&#x2019;d be dissatisfied with her original choice if she&#x2019;d only asked my advice. Anyway, she&#x2019;ll be coming to see you tomorrow morning at ten. I hope that works with your schedule.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait a minute,&#x201d; I sai...</p></p><h2>Cutting Edge: Japanese Swords in the British Museum</h2><p>The Japanese sword has long been appreciated both as a weapon and as an object of art.

Alfred Hitchcock was once so famous he was the only film director whose name appeared on the cinema marquee above the title. He disparaged actors and loathed location shooting since both threatened the precise realization of the film he had already made in his mind. Yet, in his Hollywood heyday he forged some creative collaborations he truly valued: those with composers. From the start, Hitchcock knew that music was an invaluable aid to any director of suspense movies who wanted to put his audience through the emotional wringer. From Arthur Benjamin&#39;s pivotal cantata in the 1934 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much to Bernard Herrmann&#39;s jagged soundtrack for the landmark shocker Psycho , the music was usually a visceral part of any Hitchcock movie. By the time John Williams scored Hitchcock&#39;s final film Family Plot (1976) a whole generation of moviegoers would always remember their favorite Hitchcock film with, as it were, the soundtrack attached. Here, arranged for piano, are some of the most evocative themes from some of Hitchcock&#39;s most unforgettable films.</p><p>Founded in 1947, Hal Leonard LLC has become the worlds largest print music publisher, representing some of the greatest songwriters and artists of all time.

He shows that these cultures possessed great knowledge, much of which they claimed was given them by visitors from Sirius. There are tribal cultures in present-day Africa (notably the Dogon of Mali) whose most sacred traditions are based on this theory; their knowledge of the Sirius system is astounding in its accuracy and detail, including information only recently known to modern science. <p> Many authors have speculated on the subject of extraterrestrial contact, but never before has such a detailed theory been formulated. <b>The Sirius Mystery</b> provides facts gathered during eight years of research.</p></p><p>A fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, Temple earned a degree in Oriental studies and Sanskrit at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

We see how they respond to each other, to Ault as an unsaved newcomer, and to the outside world.<br><br>Ault draws our attention to how members use the Bible as a &#x201c;handbook for life,&#x201d; applying moral absolutes taken from it, more or less successfully, to both daily life and extraordinary events. We see how the congregation deals with issues around marriage, adultery, divorce, teenage pregnancy, and alcohol abuse. Ault makes clear how the church, embodying traditional extended-family life, provides the security of like-mindedness and community to its members. He also reveals the pervasive power of gossip to engender and perpetuate divisions and conflicts within a community. And finally, Ault describes his own surprising journey of discovery, revelation, and belief during, and in the wake of, his three years studying Shawmut River and making an intimate documentary about it.<br><br>Having experienced its life personally and in depth, James Ault is remarkably placed to guide us through the world of Christian fundamentalism&#x2014;an abiding and, to many Americans, baffling phenomenon. In the course of telling his story, he builds a useful framework for better understanding the popular sources of both fundamentalism and new-right conservatism and their distinctive place in American life.</p><p>"It is vital that we learn to see fundamentalists in all traditions as vulnerable human beings like ourselves. If we simply dismiss them as either evil or hopelessly irrational, we contribute to the polarization that is putting us all in such deadly peril. James Ault has traced his own journey from hostility to understanding, and will take his readers with him. This book has made an important contribution to one of the greatest problems facing the world today."<br> - Karen Armstrong, author of <i>The Battle for God</i><br> <br>"I was swept into Ault's absorbing narrative right away. The book is a superb combination, a sympathetic portrayal of real people involved in a fundamentalist Baptist Church woven together with a well-informed portrayal of an increasingly important element in the religious and political life of America. His brave and courageous inclusion of his own journey as he worked on this project deepens and enriches the story."<br> - Harvey Cox, author of <i>Fire From Heaven</i><br> <br>"Ault is a masterful participant observer who acquires a sympathy for this movement's basic beliefs while retaining a scholar's analytical eye. A community study that reads like a novel (with a surprise ending), <i>Spirit and Flesh</i> is a remarkable American story."<br> - Joel Carpenter, author of R<i>evive Us Again: The Reawakening of American</i><br><i>Fundamentalism</i><br> <br>"Compelling for its intimate portrayal of the men and women and valuable for its insights into the larger culture of Christian fundamentalism. This book takes readers into a world far beyond the common stereotypes."<br> - Gustav Niebuhr, Correspondent and Associate Professor of Religion and Media Syracuse UniversityJames M. Ault, Jr. was educated at Harvard and Brandeis universities. After teaching at Harvard and at Smith College, he made his first film, <i>Born Again,</i> a portrait of this fundamentalist Baptist congregation, which won a Blue Ribbon at the American Film Festival and was broadcast in the United States and abroad in 1987.

Against this backdrop, he catches the case of Bruno Canizales, a high-powered lawyer with a double life, who was killed by a single silver bullet.<br>Throwing himself into his work, Mendieta begins to piece together the details of Canizales' life. The son of a former government minister, and the lover of a drug lord's daughter, Canizales it seems had a penchant for cross-dressing and edgy sex.<br>In the sweltering city of Culiac�n, Mexico's capital of narco-crime, Mendieta scrambles to follow several leads. His dogged pursuit of the killer takes him from glitzy mansions to drug dens, from down-at-the-heels reporters to glamorous transsexuals. When a second, apparently related murder surfaces, Mendieta discovers that his desire to unearth the truth has become as overpowering as any drug.</p><p><b>�lmer Mendoza </b>is a literature professor and crime novelist, a formative figure in the genre known as "narco-literature," or narco-lit. Also a dramatist and short story writer, he is best known for his series of detective novels starring detective Edgar "Lefty" Mendieta. The first Lefty Mendieta novel was <i>A Lone Murderer</i>, which immediately garnered praise for its realistic portrayal of Mexico's flourishing narco culture and the ways in which it has shaped Mexican law enforcement and politics. Mendoza has won several literature awards, including the Jos� Fuentes Mares National Literary Prize, for <i>Janis Joplin's Lover</i>, and the prestigious Tusquets Prize, for <i>Silver Bullets</i>. Mendoza lives and writes in Culiac�n, Mexico.<br>"The literary representative of modern-day Mexico in its narco-incarnation . . .

Mendoza's creation is nothing like standard pulp fiction."&#x2015;<b>Justin Warshaw</b>, <b><i>Times Literary Supplement<br></i></b><br><br>""Mendoza has transformed the corruption, chaos, and constant bloodletting of Mexico's disastrous War on Drugs into blackly comic fiction . . . The battle between the cartels is not so much Mendoza's subject matter as the medium in which the events he describes take place. The novels' very construction suggests that in this world some lives matter a lot more than others, and that some deaths are not worth investigating because it's obvious who did it . . . Murder is a part of everyday life."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>London Review of Books</i></b></i></b></p><h2>Sizzling Style: Every Word Matters (Red Sneaker Writers Book Series)</h2><p>Sizzling Style is what distinguishes a spellbinding book from an ordinary one. The writer who understands the fundamentals of fictional writing style knows how to capture readers and never let them go. Too often aspiring writers are frustrated by rejection, not realizing that the problem is not the story but the way they are telling it. In this book, bestselling author William Bernhardt brings his down-to-earth approach to the subject of style, revealing everything you need to know to write with the art and craft of a seasoned professional. Bernhardt goes beyond memorizing rules to a fresh approach, a philosophy of writing that will transform your work and take it to a higher level. Because as William Goldman famously said, &#x201c;No one really knows what will be commercial, but everyone knows good writing from bad writing.&#x201d; The book also includes exercises designed to help writers apply this approach to their own writing. William Bernhardt is the bestselling author of more than thirty books, including the blockbuster Ben Kincaid novels and Nemesis: The Final Case of Eliot Ness, currently in production as an NBC miniseries. Bernhardt is also one of the most sought-after writing instructors in the nation. He is the only person to have received the Southern Writers Gold Medal Award, the Royden B. Davis Distinguished Author Award (U Penn) and the H. Louise Cobb Distinguished Author Award (OSU), which is given "in recognition of an outstanding body of work that has profoundly influenced the way in which we understand ourselves and American society at large." The Red Sneaker Writing Center is dedicated to helping writers achieve their literary goals. What is a red sneaker writer? A committed writer seeking useful instruction and guidance rather than obfuscation and attitude. Red sneakers get the job done and so do red sneaker writers, by paying close attention to their art and craft, committing to hard work, and never quitting. Are you a red sneaker writer? If so, this book is for you.</p><p></p><h2>The Alpine Decoy (An Emma Lord Mystery)</h2><p>An Emma Lord mystery by the author of "The Alpine Christmas." <br>When a beautiful young African-American nurse with a shady past takes a job in Alpine, some locals show their true bigoted natures, filling editor-publisher Emma Lord with disgust. But when a second newcomer -- a young black man -- is found shot through the head, Emma is stuck with a story she will never forget.<br>Though Sheriff Milo Dodge connects the victim to the nurse, Emma believes there's something more sinister afoot. So she and Vida Runkel, her formidable house-and-home editor, try writing their own scenario. But the case offers too many subplots, too many suspects, and one crafty killer who leaves no tracks. That is, until Emma hits the deadly trail . . .</p><p>Mary Daheim and I go back a long way -- well, seventeen or eighteen years. That's a long time for a publishing association. Years before I became Mary's editor on the Emma Lord/Alpine series for Ballantine, I was an editorial assistant at another trade house -- and that's where we met, long distance. She lives in Seattle; I live in New York; even eighteen year ago, the phone lines stretched in both directions. At the time Mary was writing successful historical romances for my then-boss, a senior editor. One day Mary and I revealed our unbridled passion for reading crime fiction. Little did I dream then that, soon after I arrived at Ballantine, Mary would become a crime writer herself. Of course, now she's a nationally renowned one . . . and I especially treasure her novels about Emma Lord, the editor-publisher of a small-town weekly newspaper in fictional (but based on fact) Alpine, Washington. The paper is called The Alpine Advocate, which is also the title of the first novel in the series. For any readers who haven't visited Alpine, I heartily recommend starting with Book One -- and then continuing forward (in alphabetical order) to THE ALPINE BETRAYAL, THE ALPINE CHRISTMAS, THE ALPINE DECOY, THE ALPINE ESCAPE, THE ALPINE FURY, THE ALPINE GAMBLE, THE ALPINE HERO, THE ALPINE ICON, THE ALPINE JOURNEY, and (coming soon) THE ALPINE KINDRED.<br><br>--Joe Blades, Associate Publisher<b>Mary Richardson Daheim</b> started spinning stories before she could spell. Daheim has been a journalist, an editor, a public relations consultant, and a freelance writer, but fiction was always her medium of choice.

In October 2008, she was inducted into the University of Washington&#x2019;s Communication Alumni Hall of Fame. Daheim lives in her hometown of Seattle and is a direct descendant of former residents of the real Alpine, which existed as a logging town from 1910 to 1929, when it was abandoned after the mill was closed. The Alpine/Emma Lord series has created interest in the site, which was named a Washington State ghost town in July 2011. An organization called the Alpine Advocates has been formed to preserve what remains of the town as a historic site.</p><h2>The Gardening Book For Ohio</h2><p>Denny McKeown is the creator of The Bloomin&#39; Garden Center, a year-round retail garden sales business.?

Kennedy transformed horror into hope between 1963 and 1966.</b></p><p>On November 22nd, 1963, Bobby Kennedy received a phone call that altered his life forever. The president, his brother, had been shot. JFK would not survive. </p><p>In <i>The Revolution of Robert Kennedy</i>, journalist John R. Bohrer focuses in intimate and revealing detail on Bobby Kennedy's life during the three years following JFK's assassination. Torn between mourning the past and plotting his future, Bobby was placed in a sudden competition with his political enemy, Lyndon Johnson, for control of the Democratic Party. No longer the president's closest advisor, Bobby struggled to find his place within the Johnson administration, eventually deciding to leave his Cabinet post to run for the U.S. Senate, and establish an independent identity. Those overlooked years of change, from hardline Attorney General to champion of the common man, helped him develop the themes of his eventual presidential campaign.</p><p><i>The Revolution of Robert Kennedy</i> follows him on the journey from memorializing his brother's legacy to defining his own.

It will satisfy the Kennedy true believers and interest students of politics." - <i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>"The bookshelves already groan with Kennedy titles, but Mr. Bohrer makes a worthy contribution by examining a critical chapter in Robert Kennedy's public life, the period from 1963 to 1966 . . . Mr. Bohrer ably captures Kennedy at his lowest moment, far from Camelot, as he traveled the world, took public-speaking lessons, overcame his fear of crowds and grappled with JFK's legacy." - <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"This well-researched narrative details Robert Kennedy&#x2019;s life in the three years that followed his brother John&#x2019;s assassination, as he grappled with extreme grief, competed with his rival Lyndon B. Johnson, and tried to figure out his next political move." - <i>The New York Post</i></p><p>"Mr. Bohrer proves that the personal is political, showing readers how Bobby Kennedy&#x2019;s evolution from shadow to savior was, in fact, revolutionary... how Bobby Kennedy, who aged a lifetime in three years, grew from the president&#x2019;s brother to a man who might have become the president himself." - Rachel Treisman, <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i></p><p>"Jack Bohrer has brought us a new, vivid and absorbing look at Robert Kennedy's surprising transformation into the audacious hero exalted by American progressives today." - Michael Beschloss, author of PRESIDENTIAL COURAGE</p><p>"A fascinating study of a man whose political journey was as complex as he was.

Bohrer recounts RFK's three years after his brother's 1963 assassination and illuminates the many crossroads he faced in becoming his own man. This book makes Kennedy's personal and public crucible come alive with a host of unforgettable characters." - Thomas Maier, author of WHEN LIONS ROAR: THE CHURCHILLS AND THE KENNEDYS</p><p>"Bobby Kennedy's journey between JFK's assassination and his own is one of the most remarkable political transformations in American history. For anyone inspired by the passion and courage revealed in RFK's final years, Jack Bohrer brilliantly captures Kennedy's evolution from political hatchet man to becoming the compassionate hero who still inspires the world a half century later." - Joe Scarborough, Co-Host, MSNBC's Morning Joe</p><p>"Jack Bohrer has brought us a meticulously researched and vividly detailed account of the period when Bobby Kennedy, the President's brother, became Robert F. Kennedy, a giant in his own right. As Bohrer movingly chronicles, RFK demonstrated a capacity for leadership, courage and idealism our politicians would do well to summon today." - Betsy Fischer Martin, former Executive Producer of Meet the Press and Executive in Residence, American University School of Public Affairs</p><p>"Fast-paced and full of new detail, Bohrer's reevaluation of RFK's wandering years signals the arrival of an unusually gifted writer and historian." - Matt Bai, <i>author of ALL THE TRUTH IS OUT</i></p><p>"Bohrer is a beautiful writer . . . this is an exceptional book . . .

Born in Dallas, Texas, and educated in France, he served in the U.S. Air Force in the South Pacific, where an injury he received during a Japanese bombardment eventually resulted in the complete loss of his sight. In the 1950's he converted to Catholicism, married, and raised a family. In 1957, (after ten years of blindness) he miraculously regained his sight.In the late 1950s John Howard Griffin, a white man, artificially darkened his skin and took up the impossible task of masquerading as a black man in the Deep South. The book he wrote about his firsthand experience of racism galvanized America and ultimately led to death threats against him and his family.

With a presence in more than 40 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, Greenpeace is undoubtedly a dominant force in the realm of environmental activism.</p><p>This is the story of how Greenpeace came to be.</p><p>In September 1971, a small group of activists boarded a small fishing boat in Vancouver, Canada, and headed north towards Amchitka, a tiny island west of Alaska in the Aleutian Islands, where the US government was conducting underground nuclear tests.</p><p>At that time, protests against nuclear testing were not common, yet the US tests raised genuine concerns: Amchitka is not only the last refuge for endangered wildlife, but is also located in a geologically unstable region, one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world. The threat of a nuclear-triggered earthquake or tsunami was real.</p><p>Among the people sardined in the fishing boat were Robert Hunter and Robert Keziere.</p><p>The boat, named the <i>Greenpeace</i> by the small group of men aboard, raced against time as it crashed through the Gulf of Alaska, braving the oncoming winter storms. Three weeks was all they had to reach Amchitka in an attempt to halt the nuclear test. Ultimately, the voyage&#x2014;beset by bad weather, interpersonal tensions and conflicts with US officials&#x2014;was doomed. And yet the legacy of that journey lives on.</p><p>In this visceral memoir, based on a manuscript originally written over 30 years ago, Robert Hunter vividly depicts the peculiar odyssey that led to the formation of the most powerful environmental organization in the world.</p><p>Features 40 black and white photographs taken during the voyage by Robert Keziere.</p></p><p>Bob Hunter was the official chronicler on board the Greenpeace in 1971. Already a published author and a journalist in the Vancouver Sun newsroom, the task of chronicling the voyage weighed heavy on Robert Hunter, the first president of Greenpeace. "In desperation, I retreated to the Phyllis Cormack," Hunter writes. "Nobody else was aboard, so I could pound my head against the wooden fridge door in the galley and torture myself into telling the story, even though I didn&#x2019;t know what had happened to me, or us." <p>The thought of writing this book gave Hunter an ulcer. The completion of the manuscript cured it. As the official chronicler, he had a responsibility to the cause and the truth. It was a daunting task, and a project that publisher Jack McClelland axed. </p><p>The manuscript sat bundled in a drawer in the house of Robert Keziere, the trip&#x2019;s official photographer, for some thirty years. </p><p>The Greenpeace to Amchitka: An Environmental Odyssey comes to Arsenal Pulp Press thrity years after its creation, after the infighting and the legacy building, at a point in time when the fears that drove Bob Hunter and the others onto that ship have for the most part come true. </p><p>This is the story of the birth of Greenpeace, told by the official chronicler and illustrated by the official photographer. Thirty years later, are you ready to hear the truth?</p>Robert Hunter, co-founder and first president of Greenpeace, was named one of the ten eco-heroes of the 20th century by Time magazine. He is a writer, broadcaster, and speaker on the issues of the environment and climate change. He won a Governor General?s Award for his 1991 book Occupied Canada. He lives in Toronto. Robert Keziere was the chief photographer at the Vancouver Art Gallery and for the past twenty years has run a freelance business specializing in the photography of art. He lives in Vancouver.</p><h2>Suspicious Death</h2><p>Detective-Inspector Luke Thanet investigates the drowning of the disagreeable Marcia Salden, a death he is sure is not as accidental as it first appears</p><p>Dorothy Simpson worked as a French teacher and then as a marriage-guidance counsellor, before turning to writing full time. She is married with three children and lives near Maidstone, Kent The fifth book in the series, LAST SEEN ALIVE, won the Crime Writers&#39; Association Award in 1985.The eighth in Simpson's series featuring Detective Inspector Luke Thanet typifies the British author's award winners. Events in Kent are related in a measured fashion, keeping pace with the dogged investigation of a case by Thanet and his partner, Sgt. Mike Lineham. When the body of Marcia Salden is found in the River Sture, an autopsy proves she was murdered, sending the officers to the Saldens' manor house to question the victim's widower Bernard, her secretary and the housekeeper. The three answer willingly, though with an odd air of reservation that is quite different from the outright enmity expressed by the community toward the dead woman. As Thanet and Lineham search for information, they face an apparently hopeless tangle of sub rosa relationships, perhaps linked to Marcia's killing. A shrewd, cold businesswoman, she was resented for her rise from poverty and, as Lineham suspects, for a stronger reason. As Thanet and Lineham patiently separate the raveled bits in the evidence, they learn the astonishing but undeniable motive for killing the ambitious woman. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor</h2><p>The Battle of Mindor, where the forces of the New Republic, led by Luke Skywalker, take on the Black Stormtroopers, led by Lord Shadowspawn, self-styled new Emperor of the galaxy. What Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han, Solo, Chewbacca, C-3P0, R2-D2, Lando Calrissian, and the pilots of Rogue Squadron don&#39;t realize is that the Battle of Mindor is a trap devised just for them - a diabolical attempt by Lord Shadowspawn to do away with the heroes of the New Republic so that he can crush the upstarts and restore the Empire - with himself at the helm. But Lord Shadowspawn has underestimated the bravery and resourcefulness of his enemies...</p><p>Matt Stover is the author of five previous novels, including Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith; Star Wars: Shatterpoint; Star Wars: The New Jedi Order: Traitor; Heroes Die and The Blade of Tyshalle.

Rumor had it that for the price of a single cocktail in one of the <i>Queen</i>&#x2019;s least- exclusive dining clubs, one might buy a starship; for the price of a meal, one could buy not only the starship, but the port in which it docked, and the factory that had built it. A being could not simply <i>pay for </i>a berth on the <i>Corellian Queen; </i>mere wealth would never suffice. To embark upon the ultimate journey into hedonistic excess, one first had to demonstrate that one&#x2019;s breeding and manners were as exquisite as would be the pain of paying one&#x2019;s bar bill. All of which made the <i>Corellian Queen </i>one of the most irresistible terrorist targets ever: who better to terrorize than the elite of the Elite, the Powers among the powerful, the greatest of the Great?<br><br>And so when some presumably unscrupulous routing clerk in the<br>vast midreaches of the Nebula Line corporation quietly offered for<br>sale, to select parties from Kindlabethia to Nar Shaddaa, a hint as to<br>the route of the <i>Corellian Queen</i>&#x2019;s upcoming cruise, it attracted considerable interest.<br><br>Two pertinent facts remained concealed, however, from the winning<br>bidder. The first pertinent fact was that this presumably unscrupulous<br>routing clerk was neither unscrupulous nor, in fact, a<br>routing clerk, but was a skilled and resourceful agent of the intelligence<br>service of the New Republic. The second pertinent fact was<br>that the <i>Corellian Queen </i>was not cruising at all that season, having<br>been replaced by a breakaway disposable shell built to conceal a substantial fraction of a star fighter wing, led by&#x2014;as was customary in such operations&#x2014;the crack pilots of Rogue Squadron.<br><br>It was approximately the moment that R4-G7 squalled a proximity<br>alarm through his X-wing&#x2019;s sensor panel and his HUD lit up<br>with image codes for six TIE Defenders on his tail that Lieutenant<br>Derek &#x201c;Hobbie&#x201d; Klivian, late of the Alliance to Restore Freedom to<br>the Galaxy, currently of the New Republic, began to suspect that<br>Commander Antilles&#x2019;s brilliant ambush had never been brilliant at<br>all, not even a little, and he said so. In no uncertain terms. Stripped<br>of its blistering profanity, his comment was &#x201c;Wedge? This plan was<br><i>stupid. </i>You hear me? Stupid, stupid, stu<i>YOW&#x2014;</i>!&#x201d;<br><br>The <i>yow </i>was a product of multiple cannon hits that disintegrated<br>his right dorsal cannon and most of the extended wing it had been<br>attached to. This kicked his fighter into a tumble that he fought with<br>both hands on the yoke and both feet kicking attitude jets and almost<br>had under control until the pair of the Defenders closest on his tail<br>blossomed into expanding spheres of flame and debris fragments.<br><br>The twin shock fronts overtook him at exactly the wrong instant and<br>sent him flipping end- over- end straight at another Defender formation<br>streaking toward him head- on. Then tail- on, then head- on<br>again, and so forth.<br><br>His ship&#x2019;s comlink crackled as Wedge Antilles&#x2019;s fighter flashed<br>past him close enough that he could see the grin on the commander&#x2019;s<br>face. <i>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s &#x2018;stupid plan, </i>sir,<i>&#x2019; Lieutenant.&#x201d;<br><br></i>&#x201c;I suppose you think that&#x2019;s funny.&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Well, if he doesn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; </i>put in Hobbie&#x2019;s wingman, <i>&#x201c;I sure do.&#x201d;<br><br></i>&#x201c;When I want <i>your </i>opinion, Janson, I&#x2019;ll dust your ship and scan<br>for it in the wreckage.&#x201d; The skewed whirl of stars around his cockpit<br>gave his stomach a yank that threatened to make the slab of smoked<br>terrafin loin he&#x2019;d had for breakfast violently reemerge. Struggling<br>grimly with the controls, he managed to angle his ship&#x2019;s whirl just a<br>hair, which let him twitch his ship&#x2019;s nose toward the four pursuing<br>marauders as he spun. Red fire lashed from his three surviving<br>cannons, and the Defenders&#x2019; formation split open like an overripe<br>snekfruit.<br><br>Hobbie only dusted one with the cannons, but the pair of<br>proximity- fused flechette torpedoes he had thoughtfully triggered at<br>the same time flared in diverging arcs to intercept the enemy fighters;<br>these torpedo arcs terminated in spectacular explosions that<br>cracked the three remaining Defenders like rotten snuffle eggs.<br><br>&#x201c;Now, <i>that </i>was satisfying,&#x201d; he said, still fighting his controls to<br>stabilize the crippled X-wing. &#x201c;Eyeball souffl�!&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Better watch it, Hobbie&#x2014;keep that up, and somebody might start to<br>think you can fly that thing.&#x201d;<br><br></i>&#x201c;Are you <i>in </i>this fight, Janson? Or are you just gonna hang back<br>and smirk while I do all the heavy lifting?&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t decided yet.&#x201d; </i>Wes Janson&#x2019;s X-wing came out of nowhere,<br>streaking in a tight bank across Hobbie&#x2019;s subjective vertical. <i>&#x201c;Maybe<br>I can lend a hand. Or, say, a couple torps.&#x201d;<br><br></i>Two brilliant blue stars leapt from Janson&#x2019;s torpedo tubes and<br>streaked for the oncoming TIEs.<br><br>&#x201c;Uh, Wes?&#x201d; Hobbie said, flinching. &#x201c;Those weren&#x2019;t the flechette<br>torps, were they?&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Sure. What else?&#x201d;<br><br></i>&#x201c;Have you noticed that I&#x2019;m currently having just a little trouble<br><i>maneuvering</i>?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>What do you mean?</i>&#x201d; Janson asked as though honestly puzzled.<br><br>Then, after a second spent watching Hobbie&#x2019;s ship tumbling helplessly<br>directly toward his torpedoes&#x2019; targets, he said, <i>&#x201c;Oh. Uh . . .sorry?&#x201d;<br></i><br>The flechette torpedoes carried by Rogue Squadron had been designed<br>and built specifically for this operation, and they had one primary<br>purpose: to take out TIE Defenders.<br><br>The TIE Defender was the Empire&#x2019;s premier space- superiority<br>fighter. It was faster and more maneuverable than the Incom T-65<br>(better known as the X-wing); faster even than the heavily modified<br>and updated 65Bs of Rogue Squadron. The Defender was also more<br>heavily armed, packing twin ion cannons to supplement its lasers, as<br>well as dual- use launch tubes that could fire either proton torpedoes<br>or concussion missiles. The shields generated by its twin Novaldex<br>deflector generators were nearly as powerful as those found on capital<br>ships. However, the Defenders were not equipped with particle<br>shields, depending instead on their titanium- reinforced hull to absorb<br>the impact of material objects.<br><br>Each proton torpedo shell had been loaded with thousands of tiny<br>jagged bits of durasteel, packed around a core of conventional explosive.<br><br>On detonation, these tiny bits of durasteel became an expanding<br>sphere of shrapnel; though traveling with respectable velocity of<br>their own, they were most effective when set off in the path of oncoming<br>Defenders, because impact energy, after all, is determined by<br><i>relative </i>velocity. At star fighter combat speeds, flying into a cloud of<br>durasteel pellets could transform one&#x2019;s ship from a star fighter into a<br>very, very expensive cheese grater.<br><br>The four medial fighters of the oncoming Defender formation hit<br>the flechette cloud and just . . . shredded. The lateral wingers managed<br>to bank off an instant before they would have been overtaken<br>by two sequential detonations, as the explosion of one Defender&#x2019;s<br>power core triggered the other three&#x2019;s cores an eyeblink later, so that<br>the unfortunate Lieutenant Klivian was now tumbling directly<br>toward a miniature plasma nebula that blazed with enough hard radiation<br>to cook him like a bantha steak on an obsidian fry- rock at<br>double noon on Tatooine.<br><br><i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not gonna make it, Hobbie,&#x201d; </i>Janson called. <i>&#x201c;Punch out.&#x201d;<br><br></i>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;d <i>like </i>that, wouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Hobbie snarled under his<br>breath, still struggling grimly with the X-wing&#x2019;s controls. The<br>fighter&#x2019;s tumble began to slow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got it, Wes!&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t! Punch out, Hobbie&#x2014;PUNCH OUT!&#x201d;<br><br></i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got it&#x2014;I&#x2019;m gonna make it! I&#x2019;m gonna&#x2014;&#x201d; He was interrupted<br>by the final flip of his X- wing, which brought his nose into line with<br>the sight of the leading edge of the spherical debris field expanding<br>toward him at a respectable fraction of lightspeed, and Hobbie Klivian,<br>acknowledged master of both profanity and obscenity, human<br>and otherwise, not to mention casual vulgarities from a dozen<br>species and hundreds of star systems, found he had nothing to say<br>except, &#x201c;Aw, nuts.&#x201d;<br><br>He stood the X- wing on its tail, sublights blasting for a tangent,<br>but he had learned long ago that of all the Rogues, he was the one<br>who should know better than to trust his luck. He reached for the<br>eject trigger.<br><br>Just as his hand found the trigger, the ship jounced and clanged as<br>if he had his head trapped inside a Wookiee dinner gong at nightmeal.<br><br>The metaphorical Wookiee cook must have been hungry, too,<br>because the clanging went on and on and kept getting louder, and<br>the eject still, mysteriously, didn&#x2019;t seem to be working at all. This<br>mystery was solved, however, by the brief shriek of atmosphere<br>through a ragged fist- sized hole in the X- wing&#x2019;s canopy. This hole<br>was ragged because, Hobbie discovered, the fragment that had made<br>this opening had been slowed by punching through the X- wing&#x2019;s<br>titanium- alloy ventral armor. Not to mention the X- wing&#x2019;s control<br>panel, where it had not only ripped away the entire eject trigger assembly,<br>but had vaporized Hobbie&#x2019;s left hand.<br><br>He glared at his vacant wrist with more annoyance than shock or<br>panic; instead of blood or cauterized flesh, his wrist jetted only<br>sparks and smoke from overheated servomotors. He hadn&#x2019;t had a<br>real left arm since sometime before Yavin.<br><br>Of more concern was the continuing shriek of escaping atmosphere,<br>because he discovered that it was coming from his environment<br>suit&#x2019;s nitroxy generator.<br><br>He thought, <i>Oh, this sucks. </i>After everything he had survived in the<br>Galactic Civil War, he was about to be killed by a minor equipment<br>malfunction. He amended his previous thought: <i>This </i>really <i>sucks.<br><br></i>He didn&#x2019;t bother to say it out loud, because there wasn&#x2019;t enough<br>air in his cockpit to carry the sound.<br><br>There being no other useful thing he could do with his severed<br>left wrist, he jammed it into the hole in his canopy. His suit&#x2019;s autoseal<br>plastered itself to the jagged edges, but the nitroxy generator didn&#x2019;t<br>seem mollified; in fact, it was starting to feel like he had an unshielded<br>fusion core strapped to his spine.<br><br><i>Oh, yeah, </i>he thought. <i>The other hole.<br><br></i>He palmed the cockpit harness&#x2019;s snap release, twisted, and<br>stretched out his left leg, feeling downward with the toe of his boot.<br><br>He found a hole&#x2014;and the rising pressure sucked the entire boot<br>right out the bottom of his fighter before the autoseal engaged to<br>close that hole, too. He felt another impact or two down there, but<br>he couldn&#x2019;t really tell if something might have ripped his foot off.<br><br>It had been a few years since he&#x2019;d had his original left leg.<br><br>With the cockpit sealed, his nitroxy unit gradually calmed down,<br>filling the space with a breathable atmosphere that smelled only<br>faintly of scorched hair, and he began to think he might live through<br>this after all. His only problem now was that he was deharnessed and<br>stretched sideways in an extraordinarily uncomfortable twist that left<br>him unable to even turn his head enough to see where he was going.<br><br>&#x201c;Arfour,&#x201d; he said quietly, &#x201c;can you please get us back to the PRP?&#x201d;<br><br>His current position did let him see, however, his astromech&#x2019;s response<br>to the task of navigating toward the primary rendezvous<br>point, which was a spit of gap sparks and a halo of sporadic electrical<br>discharge from what was left of its turret dome. Which was slightly<br>less than half.<br><br>He sighed. &#x201c;Okay, ejection failure. And astromech damage. Crippled<br>here,&#x201d; he said into his comm. &#x201c;Awaiting manual pickup.&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Little busy right now, Hobbie. We&#x2019;ll get to you after we dust these<br>TIEs.&#x201d;<br><br></i>&#x201c;Take your time. I&#x2019;m not going anywhere. Except, y&#x2019;know, thataway.<br>Slowly. Real slowly.&#x201d;<br><br>He spent the rest of the battle hoping for a bit of help from the<br>Force when Wedge sent out the pickup detail. <i>Please, </i>he prayed<br>silently, <i>please let it be Tycho. Or Nin, or Standro. Anyone but Janson.<br><br></i>He continued this plea as a sort of meditation, kind of the way<br>Luke would talk about this stuff: he closed his eyes and visualized<br>Wedge himself showing up to tow his X- wing back to the jump<br>point. After a while, he found this image unconvincing&#x2014;somehow<br>he was never that lucky&#x2014;and so he cycled through the other<br>Rogues, and when those began to bore him, he decided it&#x2019;d be Luke<br>himself. Or Leia. Or, say, Wynssa Starflare, who always managed to<br>look absolutely stellar as the strong, independent damsel- sometimesin-<br>distress in those pre- war Imperial holodramas, because, y&#x2019;know,<br>as long as he was imagining something that was never gonna happen,<br>he might as well make it entertaining.<br><br>It turned out to be entertaining enough that he managed to pass<br>the balance of the battle drifting off to sleep with a smile on his face.<br><br>This smile lasted right up to the point where a particularly brilliant<br>flash stabbed through his eyelids and he awoke, glumly certain<br>that whatever had exploded right next to his ship was finally about to<br>snuff him. But then there came another flash, and another, and with<br>a painful twist of his body he was able to see Wes Janson&#x2019;s fighter<br>cruising alongside, only meters away. He was also able to see the<br>handheld imager Janson had pressed against his cockpit&#x2019;s canopy,<br>with which Janson continued to snap picture after picture.<br><br>Hobbie closed his eyes again. He would have preferred the explosion.<br><br><i>&#x201c;Just had to get a few shots.&#x201d; </i>Janson&#x2019;s grin was positively wicked.<br><br><i>&#x201c;You look like some kind of weird cross between a star fighter pilot and a Bat -<br>ravian gumplucker.&#x201d;<br><br></i>Hobbie shook his head exhaustedly; dealing with Janson&#x2019;s pathetic<br>excuse for a sense of humor always made him tired. &#x201c;Wes, I don&#x2019;t<br>even know what that is.&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Sure you do, Hobbie.

Lisa Lemke, author of <i>The Summer Table</i>, now changes seasons and brings her prodigious gifts to more than 75 recipes that showcase wintertime ingredients. Her soul-satisfying dishes range from a savory rye risotto with oyster mushrooms browned in butter to mouthwatering roasts and casseroles to blazingly hot chili, and even good old mac &#x2019;n&#x2019; cheese. To-die-for desserts include an apple toffee, an almond crumble, a fragrant pear pie, and sublime tiramisu. These sensational recipes will assure that everyone you love is warm, happy, and well fed.</p><p>Lisa Lemke, a freelance food consultant, recipe developer, food stylist, and television chef, lives in a small town on the west coast of Sweden. She writes about food in various media, including magazines, books, radio, television, and advertising. She is the author of <i>The Summer Table</i> (Sterling Epicure), and the host of <i>My Kitchen</i> on TV4. Together with Tommy Myllym�kki, one of Sweden's biggest chefs, she gives viewers recipes and culinary inspiration twice a day, Monday through Saturday, on the popular morning show <i>Nyhetsmorgon</i>. Lemke lives in the countryside, in an old vicarage, on the west coast of Sweden with her husband Marcus Nordgren, also a chef, and their two small children.&#x201c;It is difficult to face winter&#x2019;s dearth of those fresh-from-the-farm ingredients that are so abundant in summer. Living in an almost perpetually cold climate, swede Lemke (The Summer Table, 2015) makes the best of items like onions and rye, cauliflower and beets. Even better, her 100 recipes can, for the most part, be made in one pot or pan. Old and culinarily varied favorites, such as quiche, tiramisu, and pho, mingle with Scandinavian and contemporary takes on the familiar. For instance, a risotto made with rye, not rice. A tiramisu truffle cuts refrigeration time from 10 to 2 hours. Mac and cheese is lightened with softer and lesser amounts of dairy. And the secret of always-fabulous scrambled eggs is revealed (hint: heavy cream). Color photographs show all that can be, while frequent notes (such as cooking and cooling rice before frying it) . . . ensure home chefs are aware and educated. A good cookbook to have on hand in cool and warm weather alike.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></p><h2>As Far as the Eye Can See: Reflections of an Appalachian Trail Hiker</h2><p>David Brill&#39;s classic account of his 1979 hike of the Appalachian Trail, first published in 1990, has become a classic, not only because he represented a new generation of thru-hikers at the time, but also because it is less a memoir than a series of essays exploring the emotional and spiritual dimensions of a long journey on foot through the nature of the eastern mountains. This edition includes the original preface and an afterword developed 20 years later as Brill looked back during a reunion hike at a season of fellowship and discovery that changed his life.More and more is written about Appalachian Trail hiking, but this account has long been one of the most treasured (and best written) by those who love great writing about nature and the outdoors and humans&#39; interaction with that and each other there. Brill in 1979 was among the first of a new generation to take up thru-hiking; thousands today seek what he found.</p><p>&#x201c;Trail enthusiasts will love this one. . . .

As Far as the Eye Can See chronicles his six-month, 2,100-mile walk, a quest to grow, to breathe, to change, to discover what really mattered to him. This book is for anyone interested in getting beyond the day-to-day slog of the hike to explore the emotional and spiritual dimensions of a long journey on foot.Brill, a writer and editor at the University of Tennessee, also is the author of &#34;A Separate Place: A Family, a Cabin in the Woods, and a Journey of Love and Spirit&#34; (Dutton) and &#34;Desire and Ice: Searching for Perspective atop Denali&#34; National Geographic Adventure Press).</p><h2>A Short Course in Intellectual Self-Defense: Find Your Inner Chomsky</h2><p>What is the relationship between democracy and critical thinking? What must a citizen in a democracy know to make the word democracy meaningful? In A Short Course in Intellectual Self-Defense, historian and educator Normand Baillargeon provides readers with the tools to see through the spin and jargon of everyday politics and news reporting in order to decide for themselves what is at stake and how to ask the necessary questions to protect themselves from the manipulations of the government and the media. Whether the issue be the call to what we&#x2019;re told will be a bloodless war, the "debate" around Intelligent Design, or the meaning of a military expenditure, Baillargeon teaches readers to evaluate information and sort fact from official and media spin.</p><p>NORMAND BAILLARGEON is Professor of Education Fundamentals at the University of Qu�bec in Montreal, where he teaches on the history of pedagogy and the philosophy of education.</p><h2>Warfare Accomplished</h2><p>Warfare Accomplished</p><p></p><h2>Exploring Washington&#39;s Past: A Road Guide to History</h2><p><i>Exploring Washington&#x2019;s Past</i> tells the state&#x2019;s story in terms of where to go and what to see. With words, photographs, and maps, the authors evoke the cultural landscape and portray Washington&#x2019;s people and events from the days of the fur trade and pioneer settlement to the recent past. Capsule descriptions of small communities -- from Altoona to Zillah -- are interwoven with those of better known cities, and eastern and western Washington receive equal attention. More than two hundred photographs portray our historical landscape through images of today intermixed with a sampling of the past. This book will be an indispensable guide for residents, tourists, and armchair travelers.</p><p>This encyclopedic guide to the state of Washington does exactly what it promises: it explores the visible history of that lovely state. It is geared to the curious tourist, and offers many photographs and maps, clearly written road directions, and a good index. Entries are by eight geographic regions, alphabetical within each region and cross-referenced to other entries. Although most describe locations, boxed entries may describe "apples," "barns," or other facets of the landscape. Descriptions often quote from historical documents, adding immediacy to the historical context. The wealth of carefully coordinated detail in this exhaustive work shows a great love of its subject.

A specialist in political theory, Walsh breaks new ground in this volume, arguing, as he says in the introduction, &#x201c;that the person is transcendence, not only as an aspiration, but as his or her very reality. Nothing is higher. That is what <i>Politics of the Person as the Politics of Being</i> strives to acknowledge.&#x201d; The analysis of the person is the foundation for thinking about political community and human dignity and rights. Walsh establishes his notion of the person in the first four chapters. He begins with the question as to whether science can in any sense talk about persons. He then examines the person&#x2019;s core activities, free choice and knowledge, and reassesses the claims of the natural sciences. He considers the ground of the person and of interpersonal relationships, including our relationship with God. The final three chapters explore the unfolding of the person, imaginatively in art, in the personal &#x201c;time&#x201d; of history, and in the &#x201c;space&#x201d; of politics. <i>Politics of the Person as the Politics of Being</i> is a new way of philosophizing that is neither subjective nor objective but derived from the persons who can consider such perspectives. The book will interest students and scholars in contemporary political philosophy, philosophy of religion, and any groups interested in the person, personalism, and metaphysics.</p><p>David Walsh is professor of politics at the Catholic University of America.&#x201c;David Walsh has written a wonderful book. Because it studies the person in the context of Eric Voegelin&#x2019;s project in Order and History, it will be of great interest to Veogelin readers who have followed his search for order. . . . Walsh&#x2019;s book is uniquely and creatively a work of original thinking. He expertly situates his ideas within modern philosophical and political thought, as well as within several Voegelinian perspectives.&#x201d; (Voegelin View)<br><br>"Rare, indeed, is the book that discusses the human soul in all its amplitude with grace, discernment, and penetration. David Walsh&#x2019;s new book allows us to see that the relational human person is the alpha and omega of all philosophical and political reflection. David Walsh&#x2019;s post-metaphysical reflection, a luminous exercise in philosophical Christianity, has nothing to do with fashionable academic nihilism. And his treatments of art and 'God as the seal of the personal' are alone worth the price of admission." (Daniel J. Mahoney, Augustine Chair in Distinguished Scholarship, Assumption College)<br><br>"Politics of the Person as the Politics of Being is a dense and difficult read, but also very rewarding. In trying to describe the indescribable astonishment that each person is, Walsh keeps alive the idea of philosophy not only as linguistic analysis but also as the seeking of wisdom and truth." (<i>America</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;No philosopher, theologian, or political scientist will want to miss Walsh&#x2019;s beautiful, philosophic meditation on personhood. Walsh&#x2019;s achievement is not simply that his arguments clarify the paradoxes and insufficiencies within various attempts to capture and define the human person but also that his own searching lines of inquiry invite readers to experience with him the transcendental, grounding character of personhood.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"<i>Politics of the Person as the Politics of Being</i> is a magisterial book in the line of Gilson&#x2019;s Unity of Philosophical Experience, that is, it is a book that sees where ideas go in the light of the being in which all things are grounded. Walsh brings his previous searching reflections on the direction and content of philosophy to a brilliant conclusion in these memorable pages. This is a work of original intellect that serves to illuminate what a person is, how it is grounded in reality, how it relates to both God and to the political order." (James V. Schall, S.J., emeritus, Georgetown University)<br><br>"In reading Walsh, one gets the sense that, in its logic, thought is going somewhere, whether it likes it or not. What Walsh has spent his life seeking to accomplish is a coherent, thorough, and valid understanding of the relationship of God, man, nature, and politics in light of what it is to be a person....Almost every page contains passages and considerations that took me back to almost everything I had ever read before. . . . Continually I found understandings that so struck me that I simply had to let them sink in. This was a book that I did not want to end, even though somehow I was in a hurry to finish it to see if its conclusion would be what I suspected all along that it might be. . . . The greatness of Walsh&#x2019;s book, following on his previous ones, is that it sees that persons bear reality and give it its meaning and purpose." (<i>New Oxford Review</i>)<br><br>"David Walsh's new study is a tour de force in terms of its contribution to modern philosophy, politics, and culture and clearly shows that Walsh is a world-class philosopher. Politics of the Person is quite simply unique and groundbreaking in philosophical significance. . . . Everyone who joins in the adventure of reading this volume becomes a candidate for the disclosure of the beauty, height, breadth, and depth of the truth of the human person." (Claritas: Journal of Dialogue &amp; Culture)<br><br>&#x201c;David Walsh&#x2019;s argument in the <i>Politics of the Person as the Politics of Being</i> . . . looks first to nineteenth- and twentieth-century Continental philosophy, and then to Christian theology, for a better understanding of ourselves.&#x201d; (<i>The Review of Politics</i>)<br><br>"<i>Politics of the Person as the Politics of Being</i> is a brilliant, eloquent, and luminous meditative study, filled necessarily with paradox, owing to the limitations of analysis and of language, of which Walsh is fully cognizant, on the meaning of the person. This is an outstanding piece of work by one of the foremost scholars of his generation."

But in this explosive new book, psychologist Susan Clancy reports on years of research and contends that it is not the abuse itself that causes trauma&#x2014;but rather the narrative that is later imposed on the abuse experience. Clancy demonstrates that the most common feeling victims report is not fear or panic, but confusion. Because children don&#x20ac;&#x2122;t understand sexual encounters in the same ways that adults do, they normally accommodate their perpetrators&#x2014; something they feel intensely ashamed about as adults. The professional assumptions about the nature of childhood trauma can harm victims by reinforcing these feelings. Survivors are thus victimized not only by their abusers but also by the industry dedicated to helping them. Path-breaking and controversial, The Trauma Myth empowers survivors to tell their own stories, and radically reshapes our understanding of abuse and</p><p><b>Susan A.

On Security represents a wide range of views on shifting concepts of security at the turn of the millennium, when the tangible, bipolar arrangement of the Cold War-era world system no longer exists.<br>Unlike much work in the field, the essays in this volume do not take the state for granted as the referent object of security. Contributors probe deeper, asking what it really is that we imagine needs securing: the international system? the nation-state? culture? On Security inquires further into what constitutes security: protection against enemies? suppression of a particular ethnic or religious group? insulation against economic competitors? And finally, contributors look into how ideas about security enter the realm of public debate and become institutionalized in organizations and policies: are they based on tangible, objective threats, or do they arise from psychological and emotional attitudes about feared enemies?<br>Ranging in perspective from neorealist to postmodernist to constructivist, the essays in On Security attempt to find answers and to come to grips with some of the dilemmas confronting the idea of security today. The contributors to On Security - Barry Buzan, Beverly Crawford, James Der Derian, Daniel Deudney, Pearl-Alice Marsh, Ole Wever, and Ronnie D. Lipschutz - offer a thought-provoking overview of the ongoing debate about the nature of political reality and international relations.</p><p>&#34;Although the authors, who divide into three schools of international relations--realist, neorealist, and constructivist--primarily address the academic community, they draw from current international crises to illustrate their analyses and explore how ideas about security enter the realm of political debate and become institutionalized in organizations and practices.&#34; -- &#34;Choice&#34;</p><h2>Silver Rights</h2><p>With an introduction by Marian Wright Edelman.

The title refers to the locution used by black country folk for "civil rights," an elusive goal in the Mississippi Delta town of Drew, where sharecroppers Matthew and Mae Bertha Carter were the only black parents brave enough to send their kids to newly desegregated schools. Curry, a white field-worker for the American Friends Service Committee, visited the Carters between 1966 and 1975 and monitored their struggle; she here blends her own reflections with Mae Bertha's stories of courage and her children's tales of endurance. Edelman, as an NAACP Defense Fund lawyer, sued the local school district for maintaining segregated facilities despite the law. What emerges most clearly is the Carters' earnest, almost naive belief in justice: when the plantation overseer advised them to return their kids to the black schools, Mae Bertha played a record of President Kennedy's speech supporting the Civil Rights Act. The family endured much harassment, but seven of the 13 Carter children attended the better-equipped white schools and graduated from the only slightly less hostile University of Mississippi. Now daughter Beverly, the only Carter child to return home, is helping her mother fight for black political power. Photos.

I remember looking down on a nighttime Tel Aviv from the windows of a place taking me back to London and thinking hopelessly, &#x2018;flotsam and jetsam, that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ve become, scattered and divided. There&#x2019;s no room for us or our memories here. And it won&#x2019;t be reversed.&#x2019;&#x201d;</i><br><br> Having grown up in Britain following her family&#x2019;s exile from Palestine, doctor, author and academic Ghada Karmi leaves her adoptive home in a quest to return to her homeland. She starts work with the Palestinian Authority and gets a firsthand understanding of its bizarre bureaucracy under Israel&#x2019;s occupation.<br><br> In her quest, she takes the reader on a fascinating journey into the heart of one of the world&#x2019;s most intractable conflict zones and one of the major issues of our time. Visiting places she has not seen since childhood, her unique insights reveal a militarised and barely recognisable homeland, and her home in Jerusalem, like much of the West Bank, occupied by strangers. Her encounters with politicians, fellow Palestinians, and Israeli soldiers cause her to question what role exiles like her have in the future of their country and whether return is truly possible.</p></p><p><b>Ghada Karmi</b> was born in Jerusalem and trained as a doctor of medicine at Bristol University. She established the first British-Palestinian medical charity in 1972 and was an Associate Fellow at the Royal Institute for International Affairs.

Beautifully written, it brings to the fore the human being behind the colonized, occupied and fragmented realities of present-day Israel and Palestine. It is an individual journey into the heart of the occupation&#x2019;s darkness, where people, and not abstract ideas, are struggling with the impossibility of leading a normal life, or any life at all.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Ilan Pappe, author of <i>The Idea of Israel</i></b><i> </i><br><br> &#x201c;Ghada Karmi is versatile, cosmopolitan and highly intelligent, and comes across as both self-absorbed and deeply committed to the struggle for Palestinian rights. <i>In Search of Fatima</i> was a beautifully written and moving narrative of her displacement from Jerusalem in 1948 set against the backdrop of the major political events that shaped the course of modern Palestinian history. <i>Return</i> is both a sequel and a stand-alone memoir. On display is the same fluent writing style, the psychological insight and the outstanding skill for mixing the personal with the political.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;Avi Shlaim, <i>Guardian</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A haunting account of a Palestinian&#x2019;s sense of loss.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;<i>Belfast Telegraph</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Karmi&#x2019;s strength is to focus on her personal story. Some of the best chapters in her book relate to her visit to Amman to see her centenarian father ... She describes astutely how the Palestinians in Jordan have distanced themselves psychically from their brethren under Israeli occupation, as if their depredations had made Jordan&#x2019;s Palestinians decide &#x2018;they wanted no part of that misery&#x2019; ... The sheer bloody-mindedness of Israeli bureaucracy, honed over the decades into a machine to humiliate and intimidate, runs like a thread through the book.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;<i>New Statesman</i></b> <br><br> &#x201c;Not just life writing but writing that is alive. With perfectly attuned fidelity to the experiences it narrates, it offers a deeply engaged and engaging meditation on what it means to stay together as a people.

Early visitors, filled with a sense of American&#x2019;s Manifest Destiny, described the missionary priests and their Indian converts in terms of the Black Legend of Spanish abuse of native peoples. Later, when the Anglos settled in California and assumed the life-style of the Mexican rancheros, they viewed the Indians as a primitive laboring class, docile and exploitable. Finally, after 1849, the gold rush brought hundreds of thousands of new white immigrants, who treated the primitive "diggers" simply as threats to their own prosperity and security. Bounty hunters shot down adult Indians, and Indian children and young people were sold into slavery as "apprentices."</p><p>The engine in this evolution of white attitudes was the changing needs of the white population. Needing to discredit Hispanic claims to the land, American observers saw the Indians as victims; needing a cheap labor force themselves, they viewed the Indians as a useful class; needing unimpeded access to the resources of the Golden State, they treated the Indians simply as obstacles to be eliminated.</p></p><p><p><strong>James J.

We&#x2019;re alike in many ways, a restless beating of water and salt, a shifting and seething of secrets, of treacheries. Reckless. Dangerous.</p><p>The tide, you see, is a fickle thing: stealing in, sliding away, always, always turning. She comes while you&#x2019;re not looking, a silent, liquid thief, only to rush away again, retreating from the shore like a coward. She gives sometimes, too, though, in fleeting, unexpected moments, yielding up her treasures and her dead&#x2014;but never, ever her secrets.</p><p>And so here I sit on the dunes in my carefully mismatched clothes, hour after hour, day after day, frozen in my looking back. <i>Do not look behind you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lest you be swept away. </i>That is what scripture says. Only there is nowhere for me to look <i>but</i> back. No future. No redemption. Like Lot&#x2019;s wife, I am turned to salt, my tired eyes trained on the blue-gray horizon, where sea meets sky, where my yesterdays meet my tomorrows, a ragtag eccentric, watching and waiting for something that never comes.</p><p>Oh, I&#x2019;m quite aware of how ridiculous I am. I&#x2019;m called Dirty Mary by the locals, though Crazy Mary would be more appropriate. I&#x2019;m not dirty, but I am crazy. I have the pills and the scars to prove it. I don&#x2019;t mind the name. It keeps people at a distance, which is exactly how I like them&#x2014;the more distant, the better. I have no wish to share myself with anyone, you see, to unwrap either the then or the now, the before or the after. I move alone through the world. It&#x2019;s better that way&#x2014;safer.</p><p>There are more like me&#x2014;many, in fact&#x2014;who hide behind masks and write their own fairy tales. Bright or dark, it makes no difference. We would not have our true selves stripped bare, would not have cold eyes peering between our emotional blinds. Our sins and follies are ours alone, to mourn or rewrite as we choose.</p><p>I have chosen the latter.</p><p>I pay no attention to the buffeting wind, or to the sand gusting up from the dunes. Mother Nature, it seems, is bent on pitching a bit of a blow. Penny. They&#x2019;re calling her Penny. High time, too, I&#x2019;d say, for that good lady to show what she&#x2019;s made of. We should all do that now and again, unleash a bit of ourselves&#x2014;a flash of lightning, a growl of thunder&#x2014;just to prove to the world and the White Coats that we haven&#x2019;t been beaten, that beneath our cool, glassy surfaces we are still forces to be reckoned with.</p><p>I know about reckoning. I have lived through the reckoning.</p><p>I think of that time now, that other time, that other storm, and the day my life took its final, irrevocable turn toward disaster. I let my eyes wander briefly down the narrow strip of beach, down to Starry Point Light, hazy and chalk white in the windy distance, startled, as I always am, by how little things have changed since that awful day. And I wonder how this can be&#x2014;after all that has happened, after all I have lost. It matters little now, I suppose. And so I say let the storm come, with its wind and whipping sea. Let it take what it will. For me, the sea has already done her worst.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Chapter 2</i></p><p>Lane</p><p>Of all the rooms at the Cloister House, Lane&#x2019;s favorite was her writing room in the northeast turret. She loved the smoothly curved walls and high, curtainless windows, how the light played over the smoothly worn floorboards and turned the jars of sea glass along the sills into chalices of pastel jewels. But most of all, she loved the view, nothing short of spectacular when the day was clear and bright but even more breathtaking at night, when stars filled the sky and the moon turned the sea to quicksilver.</p><p>But tonight, as she peered over the rim of her cold cup of tea and listened to the wind gusting in off the Atlantic, there was nothing to see: no moon, no stars, nothing but the rhythmic sweep of Starry Point Light and her own reflection in the wavy panes.</p><p>They didn&#x2019;t have tropical storms in Chicago. Penny would be her first. There had been scares, of course, close calls that caught the attention of the locals and even sent a few scurrying to prepare, but they&#x2019;d been incredibly lucky, something to do with El Ni�o. Now it seemed their luck had run out. Not that she was worried. She&#x2019;d been through plenty of firsts in her life, plenty of lasts, too, and had managed to survive them all. More than five years had passed since she landed in Starry Point, the last in a sandy string of islands along North Carolina&#x2019;s Outer Banks. At the time it seemed an unlikely place for a Chicago girl to end up, a small spit of land tethered to the world by a series of narrow, sand-swept bridges. But something had whispered as she crossed that last bridge, something that said this spit of land, with its charming old lighthouse, pastel-washed bungalows, and sleepy Victorian village, this place at the end of the world, might be the perfect place to begin again. And begin again she had.</p><p>Running a bed-and-breakfast had never been her dream. In fact, until she laid eyes on the Cloister, the idea had never crossed her mind. She&#x2019;d had no idea where to start, but with a failed marriage, a failed pregnancy, and a failed novel to her credit, one more failure wasn&#x2019;t likely to make much difference one way or another.</p><p>She liked to pretend it was the view that captured her heart&#x2014;powder white dunes and teal blue seas, Starry Point Light standing tall and formidable in the distance&#x2014;but that wasn&#x2019;t the absolute truth. Those things kept her guest register full during the season, but for Lane the Cloister&#x2019;s appeal had to do with its twin Romanesque towers and rough-faced gray stone, wholly unexpected and starkly at odds with Starry Point&#x2019;s wooden shingles and white picket fences.</p><p><i>I&#x2019;m all wrong, </i>it seemed to say<i>. I don&#x2019;t belong here.</i></p><p>Yet here it stood, proud, indomitable&#x2014;a survivor. And now it belonged to her. For the first time in years, perhaps in her life, she was in charge of her own life, with no one peering over her shoulder, ready to pounce on her slightest mistake. And if running it took most of her waking hours, so what? For now, that was enough. And when the season ended&#x2014;three weeks early this year, thanks to tropical storm Penny&#x2014;there was time to pursue her freelance work: scribbling articles about things she&#x2019;d never done and places she&#x2019;d never been.</p><p>Lane&#x2019;s teacup came down with a clatter as a fresh gust of wind slapped at the windows, rattling the old panes in their frames. Everyone said that waiting was the worst. Everyone was right. Snapping off the lamp, she rose from her desk and headed downstairs.</p><p>In the kitchen she rinsed her cup and saucer, then decided to make one last round to check the locks. She had already checked once, right after the Burtons went up for the night, but these days it didn&#x2019;t pay to take chances. As if a late-season storm weren&#x2019;t excitement enough for one small town, a recent rash of break-ins on the normally sleepy island had the good people of Starry Point bolting their doors and demanding answers.</p><p>Nine break-ins reported so far: all petty, and all unsolved. But in a town where sand-sculpture contests and chowder cook-offs qualified as excitement, they might as well have been armed home invasions. And now, with her last guests fleeing inland tomorrow morning, she would soon find herself alone for the entire winter.</p><p>The thought was vaguely unsettling as she took one final peer through the curtains. Across the street, the Rourke place stood grave and forlorn. The once-fine house was empty now, and had been for years, its rear windows boarded after a fire ravaged the upper floors and took the life of five-year-old Peter Rourke. In the dark the place looked grand enough, when you couldn&#x2019;t see the overgrown shrubs and shabby lawn, or the faintly scorched brick above the third-story windows. She stifled a shiver, as she always did when her eyes lingered on the Victorian-style greenhouse hunkered against the north side of the house.</p><p>She had ventured inside once, not long after moving to Starry Point, had stood in the center of the ruined conservatory, choked with weeds and saplings, more than half its small square panes in shards on the packed earth floor. It had given her the creeps then, and it still did. But it made her a little sad, too.</p><p>It was a shame that a home that once belonged to one of Starry Point&#x2019;s most beloved mayors had been allowed to go to ruin. For years, the Preservation Society had been vowing to restore the place and open it to the public, but as far as she could tell, little progress had been made in that direction. In the meantime, years of neglect had taken their toll, until all that remained was the hollow echo of the home&#x2019;s former grandeur. And yet it remained a favorite on Starry Point&#x2019;s seasonal walking tours&#x2014;mostly because locals insisted the place was haunted. Lane didn&#x2019;t believe it, of course, but it had become clear that owning a bed-and-breakfast across from the local haunted house wasn&#x2019;t exactly bad for business.</p><p>She was surprised when the banjo clock in the hall sounded a single, throaty peal. How was it already one a.m.? The Burtons would be up in five hours, ready for breakfast and anxious to stay ahead of the weather. She didn&#x2019;t blame them. According to the news, Highway 12 was bumper-to-bumper all the way to the mainland. She only had one more window to check.</p><p>Lane went still when she saw the light, a wide, milky beam floating past the first-floor windows of the Rourke House. She&#x2019;d heard people use the expression <i>frozen to the spot </i>but had never experienced it firsthand&#x2014;until now. Her heart thumped heavily in her ears as she squinted through the curtains, following the beam&#x2019;s steady progress and trying to make sense of what she was seeing. Then, as suddenly as it had appeared, the light was gone.</p><p>The police cruiser pulled up along the curb and cut its lights. Lane watched from the window as the officers emerged from the car, relieved that Donny Breester hadn&#x2019;t decided to answer the call. But then, Starry Point&#x2019;s chief of police wasn&#x2019;t one to put himself out when there was nothing to be gained, and after five years of trying&#x2014;and failing&#x2014;maybe he&#x2019;d finally grasped that when it came to Lane Kramer, there was <i>absolutely</i> nothing to be gained.</p><p>She watched as the pair split up, then melted into the shadows at the back of the abandoned house. When they reappeared an impossibly short time later, she hurried out to meet them. The night air was thick and hazy with salt and chillier than she&#x2019;d expected. She shivered as she made her way to the street, wishing she&#x2019;d put more on her feet than a pair of flip-flops. Rick Warren and Gary Mickles were waiting for her at the base of the drive. Rick holstered his flashlight and tipped his hat. Gary spat, hooked his thumb between his paunch and his duty belt, and said nothing. Neither looked especially happy that they&#x2019;d been called.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you find anything?&#x201d; Lane aimed the question at Rick, the less annoyed-looking of the two. &#x201c;The light disappeared, but I never saw anyone moving away from the house. I&#x2019;ve been watching since I hung up with dispatch.&#x201d;</p><p>Rick was scribbling in a small notebook. &#x201c;No sign of anyone around back,&#x201d; he muttered without looking up. &#x201c;No signs of forced entry. All the windows are still boarded. So unless somebody had a key&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There was a light,&#x201d; Lane said again, shivering now, and painfully aware that she was standing outside in a bathrobe. &#x201c;It moved past the front windows, right to left, then back again.&#x201d;</p><p>Gary craned his neck in the direction of Starry Point Light and waited for the beam to sweep back around. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s your intruder right there,&#x201d; he snorted.</p><p>Lane stared at him, incredulous. &#x201c;You think I saw the beam from the lighthouse?&#x201d;</p><p>Mickles spat again and hitched up his drooping belt. &#x201c;Moves past those windows just like you said. Mystery solved.&#x201d;</p><p>Lane bit back the remark on the tip of her tongue and turned to Rick. &#x201c;The light I saw moved slowly. And it moved from right to left, not left to right. It wasn&#x2019;t the lighthouse. It was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something else.&#x201d;</p><p>Rick jotted a final note in his book, then flipped the cover closed before stuffing it back into his pocket. &#x201c;Light can do tricky things, Mrs. Kramer, especially late at night.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Especially late at night?</i> What was that supposed to mean? Were there special laws of physics that kicked in after dark?</p><p>&#x201c;Rick, I&#x2019;ve lived here for five years now, and I can promise you that if the beam from Starry Point Light came anywhere near those windows I would have seen it before tonight. If you don&#x2019;t believe me, stand here and watch it for yourself. The beam&#x2019;s too high, and it moves in the wrong direction.&#x201d;</p><p>Mickles snorted again, clearly impatient. &#x201c;Maybe the light looks different from over at your place. I read somewhere that light can bend.&#x201d;</p><p>Even Rick thought it was a stupid answer. He shot Mickles a look that told him to be quiet. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you saw, Mrs. Kramer, but I can tell you there&#x2019;s nothing there now. We&#x2019;ve checked the place out top to bottom and there&#x2019;s no way anyone was in that house tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re saying I imagined it?&#x201d;</p><p>Mickles let his breath out through his teeth, heavily scented with the onions he&#x2019;d obviously had for dinner. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t feel bad. Every time the wind blows these days, some woman&#x2019;s picking up the phone and dialing 911. You haven&#x2019;t got anything to worry about over here, though. So far all the incidents have been on the sound side. Hey, maybe you saw one of them ghosts that&#x2019;s supposed to live there&#x2014;the boy, or the old man.&#x201d;</p><p>Lane stifled a groan. It was clear that nothing she said was going to make these two take her seriously.</p><p>Warren must have sensed her frustration. &#x201c;How about I arrange for a car to drive by from time to time and keep an eye out? I&#x2019;d be happy to do that if it&#x2019;ll make you feel better, but in all honesty, I can&#x2019;t imagine anyone wanting to get inside that old house. Everyone knows it&#x2019;s been empty for years. I&#x2019;ll send that cruiser around, though.&#x201d; He tipped his hat. &#x201c;You have yourself a good rest of the night.&#x201d;</p><p>Lane fumed as she watched the cruiser&#x2019;s taillights disappear down Old Point Road. They thought she was a hysterical female, a woman living alone, given to bouts of paranoia. But they had agreed to send a patrol around. That was something, at least. She turned to look again at the Rourke House&#x2014;not a sign of life or light now&#x2014;and wondered if Mickles...</p></p><h2>The Years Of Rice And Salt: Signed</h2><p>THE YEARS OF RICE AND SALT</p><p>Kim Stanley Robinson was born in 1952 and, after travelling and working around the world, has now settled in his beloved California.

C. Beaton's beloved Agatha Raisin mystery series&#x2015;now a hit show on Acorn TV and public television.</p><p>Bossy, impulsive, and unlucky in love, the all-too-human Agatha Raisin has proved to be a surprisingly effective---and endearing---amateur sleuth. But can Agatha make it as a private investigator? After getting mugged on vacation, in what she will always think of as the Paris Incident, she decides to find out.</p><p>Agatha soon learns that running her own detective agency in the Cotswolds is not quite like starring in a Raymond Chandler movie. Instead of dames in distress with big shoulder pads, her clients are ladies with missing cats and a man whose son has run off with his car. Agatha even worries that she might be outclassed by her sixty-seven-year-old secretary, Emma Comfrey.<br>But then wealthy divorc�e Catherine Laggat-Brown walks in with their first "real" case. Mrs. Laggat-Brown's daughter has received a death threat, and when Agatha thwarts an attack on the girl at a dinner dance, she recognizes an opportunity to show what Raisin Investigations can do. Even better, the case gives her a chance to reunite with her long-absent friend, Sir Charles Fraith. As they scour the Cotswolds in search of leads, Charles' insights prove invaluable and his charms irresistible, leading poor Emma to fall madly in love with him.</p><p>As ever, Agatha bumbles her way through the case, trying her friends' patience and flirting shamelessly with the chief suspect. Will she put her tiny agency on the map, or has even the outrageous Agatha finally bitten off more than she can chew?</p></p><p><p><b><i>She's outclassed, outmatched, and outgunned...</i></b></p><p>Infuriated that her holiday was ruined by a mugging, Agatha Raisin decides to open up her own detective agency. The romance-minded sleuth is thrilled by visions of handsome fellow gumshoes and headline-making crimes&#x2014;but soon finds the only cases she can get are a non-glamorous lot of lost cats and an errant teenager. But when a wealthy divorc�e hires the agency to investigate a death threat against her daughter Cassandra, Agatha thwarts a vicious attack on the heiress bride. Now Agatha is in hot pursuit of the culprit. But when the groom's father turns up dead, Agatha must untangle a growing list of suspects, from Carsely's quiet village lanes to Paris' most fashionable streets. Soon the willfully undaunted Agatha is in trouble with French <i>and</i> British police; on the outs (again) with old friends&#x2014;and dead in the sights of a murderer.</p><p><b>"Anyone interested in...intelligent, amusing reading will want to make the acquaintance of Mrs. Agatha Raisin."</b><br><b>&#x2014;</b><i><b>Atlanta</b></i><b><i> Journal Constitution</i></b></p><p><b>"I simply love mysteries that have all the requirements necessary to make them great&#x2014;the characters, the action, the plots, and that thing we call humanity.

It is a nearly unimaginable event, one that sends June running cross-country from her small community in Connecticut to settle in the even smaller community of Moclips, Washington.

What really happened that night in Connecticut? Eventually, we find out. More importantly, we find out the meaning of the title. It is both a lament and a celebration.<em>--Chris Schluep</em></p> <p><b></b></p><p><b><strong>Guest Interview Jenny Offill in conversation with Bill Clegg</strong></b></p><p></p> <p><strong>1. The novel is paced almost like a thriller, with the pieces of the mystery coming slowly into place. Does plot come first for you when you begin a book or are you more likely to start from an image or a voice?</strong><br> In this case it started with the first three lines of the second chapter: <i>She will</i> go. For a long time the only thing I knew about the book was that a woman named June was driving away from a small town, heavy with grief and guilt and unable to stay a minute longer. Everything after those words was an unraveling of that mystery&#x2014;<i>Who is she? What is driving her away? What happened? What is the source of her grief? What do the people in the town have to say about her?</i></p> <p><strong>2. You worked on the novel for many years. Do you remember how the first spark of it came to you? </strong><br> The initial impulse came from wanting to write about where I&#x2019;m from. I grew up in a small town two hours from Manhattan and there was a regular gust of moneyed weekend and summer residents that created both a great opportunity to imagine outside of one&#x2019;s life into other possibilities, but it also caused a fair bit of resentment and tension. I wanted to write about the particular experience of such a town, and so the early writing centered on that. </p> <p><strong>3. I'm so impressed by the way you carry off many different yet distinct points of view throughout your novel. It really comes together wonderfully in the end. Did you have any models for this kind of expansive narrative? Did you start out to tell the story in that manner or was it something that evolved over time? </strong><br> Though I didn&#x2019;t consciously follow any model, Jean Stein&#x2019;s <i>Edie</i> no doubt had a strong influence as well as David Huddle&#x2019;s novel <i>The Story of a Million Years</i>. Both books get to the heart of their stories by circling them with other voices and perspectives. </p> <p><strong>4. In many ways, <i>Did You Ever Have a Family</i> seems like an extended meditation on grief and forgiveness. Were your previous memoirs regarding addiction and recovery a springboard into these themes? </strong><br> Surely, they are, though not deliberately. In my recovery I have experienced how powerful and surprising being forgiven can be. I caused a lot of wreckage before I got sober, so if certain people were going to remain in my life I knew that I would need their forgiveness. But what I didn&#x2019;t expect or count on was that in being forgiven, I would learn how to forgive the people I believed had failed or harmed me. The most powerful example of this in my life is with my father. Decades-long resentments and hurt fell away when I could finally see him as a man who did his best and fell short, and him falling short was not the full measure of his character but only a piece in a longer and more complicated story. Letting all that go and allowing myself a relationship with him in his last ten years was a miracle given how estranged we&#x2019;d been, and it is one of the things recovery gave me. In the novel there are a lot of people holding on to anger and guilt and they are lonely, which is something I identify with. Part of what I&#x2019;m exploring in the book is how forgiveness&#x2014;granting as well as receiving&#x2014;can be a beginning to an end of that isolation. </p> <p><strong>5. What book or poem first made you want to be a writer? </strong><br> Reading Natalie Babbitt&#x2019;s <i>Tuck Everlasting</i> was probably the first time where it occurred to me that someone actually came up with an idea and wrote it. And I believe it&#x2019;s the first time I thought, <i>Damn, I wish I&#x2019;d thought of that. </i> </p> <p><strong>6. What novels have you read more than once? </strong><br> I read your novel <i>Dept. of Speculation</i> twice! I read it when it first came out and then, when we decided to talk a few weeks ago, I picked it up again and could not put it down. Crikey, is it good. As nimble and witty as the writing is and as streaking as it is with literary and historical references and anecdotes, it also has this spellbinding effect that only the truth of something can produce. And the truth you are conveying is about marriage and how people happen in them. Reading your novel is a kind of thrill ride but it was also a great relief. But mainly I go back to the same small pile. Besides W. S. Merwin&#x2019;s <i>The Vixen, The Carrier of Ladders</i>, and <i>The Lice</i> (which are poetry collections, not novels), I go back to <i>Jude the Obscure</i> and Lewis Grassic Gibbon&#x2019;s A Scots <i>Quair</i> every now and again. <i>Jude the Obscure</i> because it&#x2019;s such an audacious story and I find something surprising each time, and Gibbon&#x2019;s trilogy because I read it during a time that shaped me&#x2014;an optimistic and curious stretch in my junior year in college&#x2014;and if I feel stuck or limited its peculiar music has the effect of making things seem more possible. I also have reread a lot of Deborah Eisenberg&#x2019;s short stories. <i>Under the 82nd Airborne</i> is one of the best collections of short stories ever. I remember reading it in my twenties in New York and being excited that she lived in Manhattan and was, somewhere in the city, alive and thinking. Before that I mostly read books by long-dead authors so the idea that I could sit next to her on the subway or a restaurant was mind-blowing. I did sit next to her at a play not long ago and I couldn&#x2019;t stop staring. </p> <p><strong>7. Has anything surprised you about the process of publication from the writer's side, and if so, what? </strong><br> I didn&#x2019;t count on finding the conversation about something I&#x2019;d written to be so much, um, fun. With the memoirs, the engagement with readers has been meaningful and, given the main subject matters of addiction and recovery, pretty heavy. But with the novel the exchanges so far have had a giddy pleasure on the level of gossiping about people you went to high school with. It still shocks me that anyone would know and have an opinion about the characters in <i>Did You Ever Have a Family</i>. They existed for so long as just a daydream that to have them named and commented on is startling, but in the best way. Talking about them is a kind of reunion.</p>Bill Clegg is a literary agent in New York and the author of the bestselling memoirs <i>Portrait of an Addict as a Young Man</i> and <i>Ninety Days</i>.

P. Moreland</h2><p><p>Over the past twenty-five years, no one has done more than J. P. Moreland to equip Christians to love God with their minds. In his work as a Christian philosopher, scholar, and apologist, he has influenced thousands of students, written groundbreaking books, and taught multitudes of Christians to defend their faith. </p><p>In honor of Moreland's ministry, general editors Paul M. Gould and Richard Brian Davis have assembled a team of friends and colleagues to celebrate his work. In three major parts devoted to philosophy, apologetics, and spiritual formation, scholars such as Stewart Goetz, Paul Copan, Douglas Groothuis, Scott Rae, and Klaus Issler interact with Moreland's thought and make their own contributions to these important subjects. Moreland concludes the volume with his own essay, "Reflections on the Journey Ahead."</p></p><p><b>PAUL GOULD</b> is married to Ethel and has four wonderful kids�Austin, Madeleine, Travis, and Joshua. Paul has a Masters in Philosophy of Religion and Ethics from Talbot School of Theology and a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Purdue University. He works on the Executive Team of a Christian ministry to university Professors called Faculty Commons. He is also an adjunct professor teaching the History of Ideas a the College of Southeastern, the undergraduate college of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, North Carolina.<br><br><b>DR. DAVIS</b> is associate professor and chair of the Philosophy department. He specializes in metaphysics and ontology, focusing on questions concerning individuation, substance, relations, modality, and constituent ontology. He also has interests in epistemology, philosophy of science, and philosophical theology.<p>Introduction Over the course of the past few decades, perhaps no Christian thinker has been as influential as J.P. Moreland. Thirty years ago, the idea of the importance of a Christian developing a distinctly Christian mind to take captive every thought captive to obey Christ (2 Cor. 10:5) was in its infancy in the church. Today, the Christian apologetic and intellectual landscape looks very different with apologetics clubs, conferences, ministries, blogs, radio/podcast programs, and professional societies. Much of the impetus behind this growing movement has been the work of Moreland; through his scholarly and popular writings (numbering over thirty books and hundreds of publications), university lectures, public debates, etc., he inspired a generation of young evangelicals to love God with all their minds for the sake of the Church and the fallen world in which we live.<br><br>Loving God With Your Mind is a compilation of essays in honor of Moreland written by his friends - colleagues, former students, and partners in ministry. The contributors are a veritable "who's who" in the areas of Christian philosophy, apologetics, theology, spiritual formation, and church ministry. Written to honor Moreland as well as to introduce readers to the rich intellectual resources of his thinking, this book is a treat for any fan of J.P. Moreland and any Christian interested in philosophy.<br><br>Overview Part 1, "The Building Blocks of the World," gives us a panoramic view of Moreland's metaphysics. The first essay provides a rough sketch of the world according to Moreland, addresses several worries about this overall picture, then shows that Platonic theism provides a satisfactorily powerful and satisfying view of reality. Essay 2 sketches out naturalism, shows its discord with Christian theism, and describes three lines of attack mounted by Moreland against naturalism. Garcia elaborates upon Platonism as one of Moreland's lines of attack and shows how thinking about Platonism catalyzes integration. Essay 3 deals with the problem of individuation, the dispute of which Moreland has been a central figure. This essay shows how "bare particulars" solve "the problem" and how they even give us some traction in articulating a coherent, orthodox metaphysics of the Incarnation. Essay 4 gives an overview of Moreland's understanding of a human being, summarizing his understanding of substance dualism and interacting with a few of his arguments for the existence of the soul. The first section concludes with an essay that summarizes Moreland's treatment of truth and postmodernism, and then unpacks the general ontological patterns of postmodernism, tests their ontological positions, and argues that they undercut all knowledge.<br><br>Part 2, "Thinking for Christ in the World," address a whole host of questions that arise given that there is a world to be known. Topics covered in this section include Christianity as a knowledge tradition, natural theology, relational apologetics. Essay 9 was particularly interesting to me, as it relayed Moreland's contribution to the philosophy of science and its relationship to theology and his affirmation of intelligent design. Furthermore, Keas builds on Moreland's work to outline how greater attention to epistemic virtues can guide future interdisciplinary scholarship. Essay 10 was also very interesting, as it connected Moreland's metaphysics to bioethics. Issues covered in this apologetic for pro-life activism include abortion, embryonic stem cell research, and physician-assisted suicide.<br><br>Part 3, "Living for Christ in the World," explores the emotional side of life since becoming out of touch with this is a risk of engaging in the rigors of philosophy and apologetics. Essay 11 explores Moreland's contribution to cultural apologetics by going public with his struggles with anxiety and depression. Essay 12 explores Christ in the garden of Gethsemane as an example to guide our spiritual formation. Essay 13 chronicles Moreland's development of a Christian view of how we ought to live. And finally, Essay 14 discusses Moreland's most significant book for the church, Kingdom Triangle. "The three sides of the triangle are the recovery of the Christian mind, the renovation of the soul through spiritual formation, and the restoration of the power and presence of the Holy Spirit at the center of the Christian life" (212). Erre's essay examines each of these, considering the implication of each for the church. The volume concludes with an afterword by Moreland himself, in which he charges not just Christian philosophers, but all believers in Christ, to love God with their minds with courage and resisting compromise.<br><br>Conclusion This book is a treat and highly recommended for fans of Moreland and anyone who has studied under him, whether in the classroom or via his writings. It is also a great read for anyone who appreciates philosophy. I consider this book at an intermediate level; for those who are uninitiated in philosophy, this book (especially part 1) will be a difficult read.</p><p><b>Rating:</b> 4 out of 5 stars</p><p><i>Review by Jennifer Guo on Net Galley </i></p></p><h2>The Mystery of Monster Mountain (The Three Investigators Mystery Series ; 20)</h2><p>The three young sleuths solve a case of double identity while investigating the legend of Monster Mountain.</p><p></p><h2>The Secret History of Soldiers: How Canadians Survived the Great War</h2><p>There have been thousands of books on the Great War, but most have focused on commanders, battles, strategy, and tactics. Less attention has been paid to the daily lives of the combatants, how they endured the unimaginable conditions of industrial warfare: the rain of shells, bullets, and chemical agents. In The Secret History of Soldiers, Tim Cook, Canada's foremost military historian, examines how those who survived trench warfare on the Western Front found entertainment, solace, relief, and distraction from the relentless slaughter. <br><br>These tales come from the soldiers themselves, mined from the letters, diaries, memoirs, and oral accounts of more than five hundred combatants. Rare examples of trench art, postcards, and even song sheets offer insight into a hidden society that was often irreverent, raunchy, and anti-authoritarian. Believing in supernatural stories was another way soldiers shielded themselves from the horror. While novels and poetry often depict the soldiers of the Great War as mere victims, this new history shows how the soldiers pushed back against the grim war, refusing to be broken in the mincing machine of the Western Front. <br><br>The violence of war is always present, but Cook reveals the gallows humour the soldiers employed to get through it. Over the years, both writers and historians have overlooked this aspect of the men's lives. The fighting at the front was devastating, but behind the battle lines, another layer of life existed, one that included songs, skits, art, and soldier-produced newspapers.<br><br>With his trademark narrative abilities and an unerring eye for the telling human detail, Cook has created another landmark history of Canadian military life as he reveals the secrets of how soldiers survived the carnage of the Western Front.</p><p>TIM COOK is the Great War historian at the Canadian War museum. His ten books have won numerous awards, including the 2008 J.W. Dafoe Prize for <i>At the Sharp End</i>, the 2009 Charles Taylor Prize for Literary Non-Fiction for <i>Shock Troops</i>, and the 2018 J.W. Dafoe prize for <i>Vimy</i>. He is also a two-time winner of the C.P. Stacey prize for most distinguished book in Canadian military history. In 2013, he received the Pierre Berton Award for popularizing Canadian history. He is a member of the Order of Canada.&nbsp;<br> In the soldiers&#x2019; songs, the patriotic discourse of the home front, with its exalted speech-making of one more push, was buried under a chorus of deliberately shocking satire, anti-conformity, relentless vulgarity, and merry-making. This was the grousing of everyday soldiers put to song. The cynicism expressed in the songs did not mean that the soldiers were willing to give up or embrace defeat. In fact, to sing about the army discipline, which in its extreme form was much hated, or about escaping the trenches, was a way of coping with the strain at the front and finding strength to go on. Chester Routley of the 18th Battalion was so taken with one untitled and impertinent song that he wrote it down from memory in his postwar memoirs:<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> They say we&#x2019;re going over the ocean<br> They say we&#x2019;re going over the sea, <br> They say that we&#x2019;re going to Blighty, <br> But it all sounds like bull-shit to me. <br> Bull-shit, bull-shit, it all sounds<br> Like bull-shit to me, to me, <br> Bull-shit, bull shit, it sounds<br> Just like bull-shit to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> These satirical send-ups also allowed for the trivialization of mud, lice, and sudden death. In the strange world of the trenches, where lives were ruled by fate or military discipline, one simply had to grin and bear it. This sentiment was expressed in many ways, but the soldiers&#x2019; song &#x201c;Never Mind&#x201d; (also known as &#x201c;If the Sergeant Steals Your Rum&#x201d;) captured it well:<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> If the sergeant drinks your rum, never mind <br> And your face may lose its smile, never mind<br> He&#x2019;s entitled to a tot but not the bleeding lot <br> If the sergeant drinks your rum, never mind <br> When old Jerry shells your trench, never mind <br> And your face may lose its smile, never mind<br> Though the sandbags bust and fly you have only once to die, <br> If old Jerry shells the trench, never mind<br> If you get stuck on the wire, never mind&nbsp; <br> And your face may lose its smile, never mind<br> Though you&#x2019;re stuck there all the day, they count you dead and stop your pay<br> If you get stuck on the wire, never mind<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Some troops added their own fun to the lyrics by mimicking officers or NCOs, either in speech or tone, to personalize the song for their comrades.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though soldiers liked to take their superiors down a notch, reminding those in power that the rank and file were on to their tricks, they reserved a special vitriol for those at home who would not fight. The anonymous satirical attack on conscientious objectors, &#x201c;I Don&#x2019;t Want to Be a Soldier,&#x201d; was sung with vigour:<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I don&#x2019;t want to be a soldier, I won&#x2019;t be compelled to fight:<br> I much prefer to stay in England than to battle for the right: <br> Others may be patriotic and answer King and Country&#x2019;s call, <br> But my conscience won&#x2019;t allow me&#x2014;no, my conscience won&#x2019;t <br> Allow me&#x2014;or I&#x2019;d sacrifice my all.<br> <i>Chorus</i><br> I don&#x2019;t want to be a soldier,<br> I have nought worth fighting for; <br> If I had, my conscience tells me <br> It&#x2019;s not right to go to war<br> I don&#x2019;t want to be a soldier, I feel quite happy singing psalms, <br> Tho&#x2019; I&#x2019;ve often heard the bugle sounding the call to arms:<br> I would rather be a shirker and sleep upon a feather bed, <br> Than to doss within a dug-out&#x2014;a dirty, muddy dug-out&#x2014;<br> And plaster Ticker&#x2019;s jam upon my bread.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be good to be a chap who stayed at home, when the boys return,&#x201d; wrote one Canadian stretcher-bearer in a letter about those young men who did not serve. &#x201c;This thing is just a bit too serious. We know what it is here.&#x201d; Motivated by anger at the unfair burden shouldered by those at the front, many soldiers dreamed and sang lustily about postwar revenge against the slackers at home and their own abusive superiors. The moving &#x201c;When This Lousy War Is Over,&#x201d; which was sung to the tune of &#x201c;What a Friend We Have in Jesus,&#x201d; fantasized about postwar payback.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When this lousy war is over no more soldiering for me, <br> When I get my civvy clothes on, oh how happy I shall be.<br> No more church parades on Sunday, no more begging for a pass. <br> You can tell the sergeant-major to stick his passes up his arse. <br> When this lousy war is over no more soldiering for me,<br> When I get my civvy clothes on, oh how happy I shall be. <br> No more NCOs to curse me, no more rotten army stew.<br> You can tell the old cook-sergeant, to stick his stew right up his flue. <br> When this lousy war is over no more soldiering for me,<br> When I get my civvy clothes on, oh how happy I shall be. <br> No more sergeants bawling, &#x201c;Pick it up&#x201d; and &#x201c;Put it down&#x201d; <br> If I meet the ugly bastard I&#x2019;ll kick his arse all over town.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Such feelings of anger and discontent could be aired safely in the songs, in a way that they could not be presented in private letters home, which were censored, or in direct talk with superiors, which could result in confrontations and punishment.<br> &nbsp;<br> There were also multiple songs devoted to the popular subjects of booze and sex. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s to the Good Old Beer&#x201d; and &#x201c;Drink It Down&#x201d; were celebrations of alcohol, and even abstainers were known to join in to the chorus to be a part of the social activity. The songs of drink quenched a thirst of the spirit and facilitated male bonding. The rough culture of the soldiers was revealed more boldly, and bawdily, through sexual songs such as &#x201c;My Nelly, Skibboo,&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Charlotte, the Harlot,&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh, Florea&#x2019;s [or Florrie&#x2019;s] New Drawers,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Three German Officers.&#x201d; The most famous dirty song of them all, &#x201c;Mademoiselle from Armenti�res,&#x201d; with its ever-changing and increasingly vulgar lines, is known to have at least 700 recorded versions. And this doesn&#x2019;t include most of the unprintable ones, with the lyrics degenerating into incest and bestiality. &#x201c;Certainly some of the verses we sang were pretty ripe,&#x201d; said Ernest Black in his memoirs, with little more than a literary shrug.<br> &nbsp;<br> The more blasphemous the song, the more it was sung with gusto, with some of the raunchiest songs being belted out on the march. Soldiers were not known as foot-sloggers for nothing, and it was not uncommon for them to march in their heavy hobnailed boots for kilometres behind the lines, carrying gear weighing more than sixty pounds. Lieutenant Thomas Dinesen, a Danish national who enlisted in the CEF and would later receive the Victoria Cross for fierce fighting at the Battle of Amiens, recounted the joy men took in shouting irreverent lyrics while on the march:<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Again and again we go back to the good old <i>Pack Up Your Troubles</i>; or else we roar so that the whole countryside may hear: <i>The Gang&#x2019;s All Here!</i> But the best of the lot is the everlasting and ever-varying song of <i>Mademoiselle from Armenti�res</i>:<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Oh, madam, have you any good wine?<br> Parley voo,<br> Oh, madam, have you any good wine?<br> Parley voo,<br> Oh, madam, have you any good wine, <br> Fit for a soldier from the line?<br> Hinky dinky, parley voo.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It continued, &#x201c;Oh, madam, have you a daughter fine? Yes, I have a daughter fine. Then ...&#x201d; Our imagination pictures the continuation of the song in lusty and vivid colouring, although in any case we have now turned our back on all such pleasures for some time to come.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Excerpted from <i>The Secret History of Soldiers</i> by Tim Cook.

We meet characters who reappear throughout the stories: Vince, the tough but charming union foreman and &#x201c;big shot&#x201d; father to Buddy, our American-born narrator; Chris, the battle-scarred union president targeted by McCarthyism; Rico, the spirited young king of the neighborhood who will fall victim to Vietnam; Stephanie, the beautiful mestiza who marrie up; and many others who age and change in ironic counterpint to persistent themes of loyalty, fierce ethnic pride, and a willingness to struggle against hostile forces in society.

Babies are born. The migrant fisheries worker gets a nine-to-five job, and his children go to college.

More of a discursive novel that an anthology of tales, the book narrates the experience of several generations of Filipinos who settle on the West Coast before WW II and raise children who eventually move deeper into the US--both psychically and geographically. Buddy, who tells the tale, is a schoolteacher whose easy authority over his students conceals a deep ambivalence about his own identity and ambitions. Buddy's father Vince was part of the great wave of Filipinos who emigrated back and forth during the 1920s and '30s according to the rhythms and needs of the fisheries and canneries of the Pacific Northwest. In the best second- generation style, Buddy gets an education and settles himself in the suburban middle-class that his father had always held out to him as his goal and station in life. But the introspective Buddy keeps looking over his shoulder and wondering what might have happened to him had he taken one different turn or another along the way. In ``Rico'' and ``Home,'' he describes the tragedy of a working-class friend from high school who, lacking Buddy's college exemption, is drafted, goes to Vietnam, and never recovers. ``Stephie'' recounts a meeting between Buddy and an old flame who dumped him years before for a white law student, while ``Dancer'' is an account of Buddy's meeting with his grown half-sister, abandoned by their father, who refused publicly to acknowledge that he had kept a mistress in the States. Though bound together with the same characters and similar settings, the stories manage to provide a broad and very rich portrait of life among immigrants, exiles, and more-or-less happily settled newcomers from the Philippines. A skillfully drawn first collection, with a quiet intensity that captures the imagination and stirs the heart. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Gruchow ( Journal of a Prairie Year ) here captures the unconventional beauty of the West with landscapes of the U.S. and presents a compelling case for their preservation. Indicting our cultural penchant for reshaping nature ("Our backyards have become as regular and predictable as our McDonalds"), the author contends that we are putting ourselves on the endangered species list: "We may have lost our awe of nature, but its power remains, and to the extent that we are unmindful of that power, we are less, not more, secure." The book is primarily a celebration of those rugged places that still permit us to see that power. The occasional digressionsan anecdote about John Berryman or a hymn remembered from boyhoodserve to refresh rather than obstruct, and are neatly tied in with the main narrative. Whether tracing the remnants of the Oregon Trail or traversing the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming, Gruchow describes, instructs and reflects with the self-assurance of one in complete command of his subject. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.This series of interconnected essays reflects one man's exploration of natural places, from the plains of his native Minnesota to the mountains of Wyoming. Gruchow mixes his observations of the natural world with philosophical meanderings, often condemning our present age for its excesses and creeping homogeneity. Among the chapters are descriptions of a modern tour along the old Oregon Trail, walking expeditions into the Bighorn Mountains, and the migration of sandhill cranes. Some of Gruchow's observations are mundane; many are arresting. For all libraries with active natural history collections.

The representation of the nude figure was one of the most contraversial issues in Victorian art. This publication surveys the full range of Victorian representations of the nude, both male and female concentrating on painting, sculpture and drawing, but also exploring the artistic depiction of the &#34;naked&#34; body in other media, both &#34;high&#34; and &#34;low&#34;, including photography, popular illustration, advertizing imagery and caricature, foregrounding issues of morality, sexuality and desire that remain relevant in the 21st century.</p><p>Alison Smith is a Curator at Tate Britain. She is the author of The Victorian Nude: Sexuality, Morality and Art (1996).Serving as the catalog for the first major exhibition in the Linbury Galleries at the Tate Museum in London, this sumptuous and sensual volume focuses primarily on painting, though it does include drawings, sculpture, and early forms of photography and silent film stills. Smith, whose Victorian Nude: Sexuality, Morality, and Art provided a broad cultural context of the topic, showcases work by John Singer Sargent, Frederic Leighton, John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and others. The works are organized into six categories: "The English Nude," "The Classical Nude," "The Private Nude," "The Artist's Studio," "Sensation!: The Nude in High Art," and "The Modern Nude." The unlikely juxtaposition of Victorian mores with nude imagery provides an alternate sensibility to Victorian England, both enlightening the mind and pleasing the eye. Three richly illustrated essays by Smith, Martin Myrone, and Michael Hyatt frame the work. All academic and larger public libraries should own this title.

With a passionate believer&#x2019;s heart and investigative flair, Alton Gansky looks closely at every recorded event that happened from the moment Christ left the tomb until he ascended into heaven. <p>Among the eighteen chapters are: "A Peek Inside the Tomb," "A Provocative Pondering of Angels," "Mountaintop Experience," "Breakfast by the Sea," and "The Big Exit.</p></p><p>Novelist and former pastor Gansky (<i>The Incumbent</i>) turns to nonfiction, taking readers back to the 40 days Jesus spent on earth after his resurrection. Too few books have treated this important topic; unfortunately, Gansky offers mostly apologetics, and clumsily done apologetics at that. He devotes the first 75 pages not to the doings of the resurrected Jesus, but to rehashing the garden of Gethsemane, the Cross and Mary at the tomb. His main aim seems to be to persuade readers that the events of the New Testament really happened, and to this end, he considers, and tidily dismisses, several "shaky" attempts to explain away the Resurrection. When Gansky does turn to his ostensible subject, he devotes too much space to summarizing, rather than probing the meaning of, familiar biblical stories. His prose is by turns melodramatic ("When Jesus died, her world died with him") and cutesy (as when he refers to the author of the third Gospel, whom Christian tradition describes as a physician, as "Dr. Luke"). One redeeming feature of the book is the attention Gansky gives women; his discussions of Mary Magdalene may capture the imagination of Dan Brown's more evangelical fans. But overall, this is a disappointment. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He grew up in the Midwestern United States and has a BS in Geophysical Sciences from the University of Chicago, MSc in Palaeobiology from the University of Bristol (UK), and PhD in Earth and Environmental Sciences from Columbia University in New York. At age thirty-one, Steve is widely recognized as one of the leading paleontologists of his generation. He has written over one hundred peer-reviewed scientific papers during his decade of research in the field, named and described over ten new species of dinosaurs, and led groundbreaking studies on how dinosaurs rose to dominance and went extinct. One of his particular research interests is the evolutionary transition between dinosaurs and birds and he is a noted specialist on the anatomy, genealogy, and evolution of the carnivorous dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor.Excellent...a superb combination of good argument and good writing. -- Matt Ridley Full of adventures and humour. Abundant photographs and illustrations bring these stories to life * Science * Kind in tone and generous in description...[this] memoirlike writing is silly and lovable, making for one big adventure. * The Paris Review * He is a working scientist in the early stages of his career, so his tales have a freshness and an engaging immediacy that you don't get from the pens of scientists long past their productive years and with the leisure to write. Like Alexander Hamilton, he really does write as though he's running out of time, so one can excuse him if his style bubbles over into breathlessness. And best of all, he gives an extensive bibliography of semi-popular and scholarly sources, many of them so new that the ink is hardly dry. This is science at first hand, meant for grown-ups. -- Henry Geee * The Literary Review * A must-have for fans of ancient reptiles and their lost world. * Kirkus Reviews * [Brusatte's] captivating text explores the excitement associated with searching for and discovering new dinosaur species, provides clues to many long-standing questions associated with dinosaurs. . . a mix of memoir, chronicling Brusatte's personal odyssey from a child smitten by dinosaurs to a member of a vibrant scholarly community, and first-rate science writing for the general public. * Publishers Weekly * The ultimate dinosaur biography * Scientific American * This is scientific storytelling at its most visceral, striding with the beasts through their Triassic dawn, Jurassic dominance, and abrupt demise in the Cretaceous. * Nature * Fantastic . . . Superbly illustrated with photos and art, this is popular-science writing at its best. -- Nancy Bent With his new book The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs esteemed palaeontologist and author Steve Brusatte shows that the fun, fascinating and fact-filled story of the dinosaurs is still very much alive after 66 million years. Simply, a must read. -- Ben Garrod, BBC TV presenter As a scientist on the front lines of discovery, Brusatte delivers a cutting-edge account of Earth's most awe-inspiring age, and does so with great skill, humor and wonder. In his thrilling account of the revolutions and innovations that brought dinosaurs to rule the world for a near eternity, Brusatte captures both the majesty of the creatures he studies, as well as the breathtaking evolutionary ride that transformed these once scrawny also-rans into the myth-making tyrants of legend. It's the most epic chapter of earth history, and here it's told vividly by one of the world's top paleontologists. -- Peter Brannen, author of <i>The Ends of the World</i> Steve Brusatte's The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is a triumph. Written by one of our young leaders of the field, he brings new discoveries, a taste for a good yarn, and his infectious enthusiasm to some of the epic tales of paleontology. It is hard to read Brusatte and not love lost worlds. -- Neil Shubin, author of <i>Your Inner Fish</i> The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is a work of solid modern science, updating the fallacies and fancies of antiquated paleontology, revealing the quantum leaps in understanding of this modern science. But it is more than that. It is a personal quest full of enthusiasm and joy, getting beneath the dust to reveal the scales and the feathers of dinosaurs. -- Steve Backshall, Naturalist and BBC TV Presenter Steve Brusatte is doing some of the most exciting research on dinosaurs today, and he brings that excitement to The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs. Whether he's recounting remarkable fossil discoveries or explaining millions of years of evolutionary change, Brusatte shows just how much our understanding of dinosaurs has changed in just the past decade. -- Carl Zimmer, author of <i>Evolution: Making Sense of Life</i> An up-to-the-minute account of the long history and remarkable biology of the extraordinary animals that capture the imagination of every child. The dinosaurs are much more varied than the popular picture of lumbering giants and matching meat eaters. Steve Brusatte expertly leads the reader through the latest discoveries to unravel their great range of lifestyles in a vanished world. He explores the research that led to the realisation that dinosaurs Iive on - as birds. The book is an appropriate antidote to the hubris that puts our human species at the centre of the living world. -- Professor Richard Fortey A masterpiece of science writing * The Washington Post * A vibrant view of how dinosaurs originated and what happened to our Mesozoic favourites. Brusatte is as adept a scientific storyteller as any reader could ask for. * The Spectator * The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is a lovely book. Brusatte has a wonderful knack for conjuring vivid worlds out of a few shards of petrified bone. He is excellent company as a narrator, steering a course between pedantry and patronising oversimplification with flair, and unafraid to guide the reader through some fairly complicated patches of science when he feels it is worth it. -- Oliver Moody * The Times * A gripping read in the best traditions of popular science -- Andrew Anthony * The Observer * Thrilling . . . the best book on the subject written for the general reader since the 1980s. -- Tom Holland * The Sunday Times *</p><h2>Prayers of David, The: Becoming a Person after God&#39;s Own Heart</h2><p>The many insights in this book show long-time believers and seekers how to pray powerful prayers from the heart and glean enduring truths that have remarkable relevance for today.

The Inspector Montalbano series has been translated into thirty-two languages and was adapted for Italian television, screened on BBC4. The Potter&#39;s Field, the thirteenth book in the series, was awarded the Crime Writers&#39; Association&#39;s International Dagger for the best crime novel translated into English. In addition to his phenomenally successful Inspector Montalbano series, he is also the author of the historical comic mysteries Hunting Season and The Brewer of Preston. He lives in Rome.<b>1</b><p>He awoke with a start and sat up in bed, eyes already open. He was sure he&#x2019;d heard someone talking in his bedroom. And since he was alone in the house, he became alarmed.</p><p>Then he started laughing, having remembered that Livia had shown up unannounced at his place that evening. The surprise visit had pleased him immensely, at least at first. And there she was now, sleeping soundly beside him.</p><p>A still-violet shaft of the dawn&#x2019;s very earliest light shone through the window shutter. He let his eyelids droop without bothering to look at the clock, in hopes of getting a few more hours of sleep.</p><p>But then his eyes suddenly popped open again. Something had just occurred to him.</p><p>If someone had spoken in his bedroom, it could only have been Livia. She&#x2019;d therefore been talking in her sleep. But this had never happened before. Or perhaps it wasn&#x2019;t the first time. But if she had in fact talked in her sleep before, she&#x2019;d done it so quietly that it hadn&#x2019;t woken him up.</p><p>And it was possible she was, at that moment, still in the same dream state and might say a few more words.</p><p>So this was an opportunity not to be missed.</p><p>People who suddenly start talking in their sleep can&#x2019;t help but say true things, the truths that they have inside them. He remembered reading that it was impossible to tell lies or stretch the truth in a dream state, because one is defenseless when asleep, as helpless and innocent as a baby.</p><p>It was very important not to miss anything of what Livia was saying. Important for two reasons. The first was general in nature, being that a man can live a hundred years at a woman&#x2019;s side, sleep with her, have children with her, breathe the same air as her, and think he knows her as well as humanly possible, and still, in the end, feel as though he never really knows what she is like deep inside.</p><p>The other reason was more specific and immediate in nature.</p><p>He carefully got out of bed and went and looked outside through the slats of the shutter. It promised to be a lovely day, without clouds or wind.</p><p>Then he went over to Livia&#x2019;s side of the bed, pulled up a chair, and sat down at the head, as in an all-night vigil at the hospital.</p><p>The previous evening&#x2014;and this was the more specific reason&#x2014;Livia had raised a big stink in a fit of jealousy, ruining the pleasure he had felt by her surprise visit.</p><p>Things had gone as follows.</p><p>The telephone had rung and she went to answer.</p><p>But as soon as she said hello, a woman&#x2019;s voice at the other end had said:</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry, I must have the wrong number.&#x201d;</p><p>And she promptly hung up.</p><p>And so Livia got it in her head that the caller had been a woman he was having an affair with, that they&#x2019;d arranged to meet that evening, and that when she&#x2019;d heard Livia&#x2019;s voice she&#x2019;d hung up.</p><p>&#x201c;I guess I rained on your parade, eh? . . . When the cat&#x2019;s away, the mice will play! . . . Out of sight, out of mind! . . .&#x201d;</p><p>There was no making her see reason, and things ended terribly that evening because Montalbano had reacted badly, disgusted not so much by Livia&#x2019;s suspicions as by the endless barrage of clich�s she kept firing at him.</p><p>So Montalbano was now hoping that Livia would say something stupid in her sleep, anything that might give him ammunition for a proper revenge.</p><p>He suddenly had a great desire to smoke a cigarette but restrained himself&#x2014;first, because if Livia woke up and found him smoking in the bedroom, a revolution might break out, and second, because the smoke itself might wake her up.</p><p>About two hours later, he got a cramp in his left calf.</p><p>To make it go away, he started swinging his leg back and forth and, as a result, ended up dealing the wooden bed frame a violent kick with his bare foot.</p><p>It hurt like hell, but he managed to hold back the avalanche of curses that threatened to burst out of him.</p><p>The kick had an effect, however, because Livia sighed, moved a little, and then spoke.</p><p>Giving first a little laugh, in a full voice with no trace of hoarseness, she said distinctly:</p><p>&#x201c;No, Carlo, not from behind.&#x201d;</p><p>Montalbano nearly fell out of his chair. This was a bit too much of a good thing, for Chrissakes!</p><p>A couple of muttered words would have sufficed, just enough for him to build a castle of baseless accusations, Jesuit-like.</p><p>But Livia had uttered a whole sentence, loud and clear! Fuck!</p><p>As if she had been completely awake.</p><p>And it was a sentence that suggested just about everything, even the worst.</p><p>Meanwhile, she had never said a word to him about any Carlo. Why not?</p><p>If she&#x2019;d never mentioned him, there must be a reason.</p><p>And then, what exactly was it she didn&#x2019;t want Carlo to do to her from behind?</p><p>Did that mean: from in front, okay, but not from behind?</p><p>He broke into a cold sweat.</p><p>He was tempted to wake Livia up, shake her roughly and, glaring wild-eyed, ask her in an imperious, cop-like voice:</p><p>&#x201c;Who is Carlo? Is he your lover?&#x201d;</p><p>But she was a woman, after all.</p><p>And therefore likely to deny everything, even when groggy with sleep. No, that would be a wrong move.</p><p>It was best to summon the strength to wait a while and try to broach the subject at the right moment.</p><p>But when was the right moment?</p><p>Anyway, he would need to have a certain amount of time at his disposal, since it would be a mistake to bring the question up directly. Livia would immediately go on the defensive. No, he needed to take a roundabout approach, without arousing any suspicion.</p><p>He decided to go and take a shower.</p><p>Going back to bed was now out of the question.</p><p>He was drinking his first coffee of the morning when the telephone rang.</p><p>By now it was eight o&#x2019;clock. He wasn&#x2019;t in the mood to hear about any little murders. If anything, he might kill somebody himself instead, given half a chance.</p><p>Preferably someone by the name of Carlo.</p><p>He&#x2019;d guessed right. It was Catarella.</p><p>&#x201c;Ahh Chief, Chief! Wha&#x2019;z ya doin&#x2019;, sleepin&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Cat, I was awake.

I&#x2019;m looking for a Signor Piritone and I am&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You better make yourself scarce, and fast&#x2014;I mean it.&#x201d;</p><p>Montalbano lost patience.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Inspector Montalbano, goddammit!&#x201d;</p><p>The man looked surprised.</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Would you like to see my ID?&#x201d;</p><p>The porter turned red in the face.</p><p>&#x201c;Christ, it&#x2019;s true! Now I rec&#x2019;nize ya! I&#x2019;m sorry, I thought you were somebody tryin&#x2019; t&#x2019; fuck wit&#x2019; me. I apologize, sir. But look, there&#x2019;s nobody here named Piritone.&#x201d;</p><p>Naturally, Catarella, as usual, had given him the wrong name.</p><p>&#x201c;Is there anyone with a similar name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a dottor Peritore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That could be him. What floor?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Third.&#x201d;</p><p>The porter walked him to the elevator, endlessly excusing himself and bowing.</p><p>It occurred to Montalbano that one of these days Catarella, by screwing up every name he gave him, was going to get him shot by someone who was a little on edge.</p><p>The slender, blond, well-dressed, bespectacled man of about forty who opened the door for the inspector was not as obnoxious as the inspector had hoped.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, I&#x2019;m Montalbano.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please come in, Inspector, just follow me. I was forewarned of your visit. Naturally the apartment is a mess; my wife and I didn&#x2019;t want to touch anything before you saw it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, I should have a look around.&#x201d;</p><p>Bedroom, dining room, guest room, living room, study, kitchen, and two bathrooms, all turned upside down.</p><p>Armoires and cabinets thrown open, contents scattered all over the floor, a bookcase completely emptied, books strewn everywhere, desks and consoles with all their drawers open.</p><p>Policemen and burglars had one thing in common when searching somebody&#x2019;s home: even an earthquake left things in slightly better order.</p><p>In the kitchen was a young woman of about thirty, also blonde, pretty and polite.</p><p>&#x201c;This is my wife, Caterina.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Would you like some coffee?&#x201d; the woman asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, why not?&#x201d; said the inspector.</p><p>After all, the kitchen was less topsy-turvy than any of the other rooms.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s best if we talk in here,&#x201d; said Montalbano, sitting down in a chair.</p><p>Peritore did the same.</p><p>&#x201c;The front door didn&#x2019;t look forced to me,&#x201d; the inspector continued. &#x201c;Did they come in through the windows?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, they just used our keys,&#x201d; said Peritore.</p><p>He stuck a hand in his pocket, took out a set of keys, and set them on the table.</p><p>&#x201c;They left them in the entrance hall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. So you weren&#x2019;t home when the burglary occurred?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Last night we slept at our seaside house, at Punta Piccola.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah. And how did you get in if the burglars had your keys?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I always keep an extra set with the porter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, I don&#x2019;t quite understand. So where did the burglars get the keys they used to enter your apartment?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;From our seaside house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;While you were asleep?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And they didn&#x2019;t steal anything from that house?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They certainly did.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So in fact there were two robberies?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I beg your pardon, Inspector,&#x201d; said Signora Caterina, pouring his coffee. &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s better if I tell you. My husband is having trouble putting his thoughts in order. So. This morning we woke up around six, both of us with headaches. And we immediately realized that someone had broken in through the front door of our seaside home, knocked us out with some sort of gas, and had the run of the place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t hear anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Strange. Because, you see, they had to break through your front door before they could gas you. You just said so yourself. And so, you should have heard . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, we were . . .&#x201d;</p><p>The woman blushed.</p><p>&#x201c;You were?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s say we were a bit tipsy. We were celebrating our fifth wedding anniversary.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we would even have heard a cannon shot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The burglars apparently found my husband&#x2019;s wallet in his jacket, along with his ID card and our address&#x2014;this one, I mean&#x2014;as well as the keys to this place and to the car. So they quietly got into our car, came here, opened the door, stole what they wanted to steal, and went on their way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What did they take?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, aside from the car, they didn&#x2019;t take very much from the seaside house, relatively speaking. Our wedding rings, my husband&#x2019;s Rolex, my diamond-studded watch, a rather expensive necklace of mine, two thousand euros in cash, both of our computers, cell phones, and our credit cards, which we immediately had canceled.&#x201d;</p><p>Not very much? If you say so.</p><p>&#x201c;And a seascape by Carr�,&#x201d; the lady concluded, cool as a cucumber.</p><p>Montalbano gave a start.</p><p>&#x201c;A seascape by Carr�? And you had it out there, just like that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, we were hoping no one would know how much it was worth.&#x201d;</p><p>Whereas those guys certainly did know how much it was worth.</p><p>&#x201c;And what about here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here they made off with a lot more. For starters, my jewel box with everything inside.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Valuable stuff?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;About a million and a half euros.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What else?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My husband&#x2019;s four other Rolexes. He collects them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;F...</p></p><h2>Paradise Lost</h2><p>On Saturday 9th September, 1922, the victorious Turkish cavalry rode into Smyrna, the richest and most cosmopolitan city in the Ottoman Empire.

Yet Pistono did not originally intend to fight for social justice in Tibet-he had gone there as a Buddhist pilgrim. <br><br> Disillusioned by a career in American politics, he had gone to the Himalayas looking for a simpler way of life. After encountering Buddhism in Nepal, Pistono's quest led him to Tibet and to a meditation master whose spiritual brother is Sogyal Rinpoche, bestselling author of <i>The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying</i>. Pistono not only became the master's student but also couriered messages to him in Tibet from the Dalai Lama in India. This began an extraordinary, and ultimately vital, adventure. <br><br> <i>In the Shadow of the Buddha</i> is a book about Tibet through the eyes of a devotee-a stranger hiding in plain sight. It's about how a culture's rich spiritual past is slipping away against the force of a tyrannical future. It's about how Tibetans live today, and the tenacity of their faith in the future in spite of dire repression and abuse. It's also about Pistono's own journey from being a frustrated political activist to becoming a practicing Buddhist mystic, a man who traveled thousands of miles and risked his own life to pursue freedom and peace.<br><br>Watch a Video<p> </p></p><p>Matteo Pistono is a writer, practitioner of Tibetan Buddhism, and author of <i>In the Shadow of the Buddha: Secret Journeys, Sacred Histories, and Spiritual Discovery in Tibet</i>. Pistono&#x2019;s images and writings about Tibetan and Himalayan cultural, political, and spiritual landscapes have appeared in BBC's In-Pictures, <i>Men's Journal</i>, <i>Kyoto Journal</i>, and <i>HIMAL South Asia</i>. Pistono was born and raised in Wyoming where he completed his undergraduate degree in Anthropology from the University of Wyoming, and in 1997 he obtained his Masters of Arts degree in Indian Philosophy from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. After working with the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. on Tibetan cultural programs, Pistono lived and traveled throughout the Himalayas for a decade, bringing to the West graphic accounts and photos of China&#x2019;s human rights abuses in Tibet. He is the founder of Nekorpa, a foundation working to protect sacred pilgrimage sites around the world, and he sits on the Executive Council of the International Network of Engaged Buddhists, Rigpa Fellowship, and the Conservancy for Tibetan Art and Culture. Pistono and his wife, Monica, divide their time between Colorado, Washington D.C., and Asia."This story of Matteo Pistono's quest to visit places in Tibet associated with Tert�n Sogyal, the adept who was a companion of the 13th Dalai Lama, is revealing not only of the Tert�n's life, but also of circumstances in contemporary Tibet." <br> -The Dalai Lama <br><br> "Part spy thriller, part Dharma travelogue, part spiritual autobiography, <i>In the Shadow of the Buddha</i> is one hundred percent page-turner. Matteo Pistono's tale of journey's both inner and outer comes packed with adventure and inspiration-a real treat anyone can relish." <br> -Daniel Goleman, author of <i>Emotional Intelligence</i> <br><br> "What a fabulous saga! A mystical tale of defending the land of the Buddha Dharma at the turn of the 20th century interwoven with the life and death struggle now going on at the turn of the 21st. This moving account is written beautifully from the heart, and it lifts the heart to read it. It is both unearthly and powerfully real. I recommend it with the strongest enthusiasm." <br> -Robert Thurman, author of <i>Inner Revolution</i> and <i>Infinite Life: Awakening to Bliss Within</i> <br><br> "Matteo Pistono is the James Bond of Tibetan Buddhism. <i>In the Shadow of the Buddha</i> is filled with perilous motorcycle rides, secret documents and romantic liaisons. Pistono also manages to find time to meditate and ponder the nature of the Buddha mind. A heroic, compelling tale that will leave you both shaken and stirred." <br> -Eric Weiner, author of <i>The Geography of Bliss: One Grump's Search for the Happiest Places in the World</i> <br><br> "Matteo Pistono chose a journey, that inside and outside, would lead him into unfamiliar territory. He followed the path of one of Tibet's great mystics through the Land of Snows, but what he encountered was a mass of contradictions: the elusive past and the intrusive present, brutality and torture greeted with non-violence and compassion, his own anger against all the abuses and a desire for peace and enlightenment. It is this tension of opposite forces and Matteo's desire to transcend them that makes this story fascinating." <br> -Peter Gabriel, musician, humanitarian</p><h2>Wound Up in Murder (A Yarn Retreat Mystery)</h2><p><b>In the newest Yarn Retreat Mystery from the national bestselling author of <i>Silence of the Lamb&#x2019;s Wool</i>, dessert chef Casey Feldstein continues to develop her hidden talents for knitting...and solving murders.</b><br><br>With two yarn retreats in the bag, Casey is looking forward to running her third one at Cadbury by the Sea&#x2019;s Vista Del Mar hotel on the Monterey Peninsula.

I know what the retreat is about. No more depending on one person to lead the workshops. And I have help with the other stuff, too.&#x201d; I looked to my audience to see his reaction. Julius, my sleek black cat, blinked his yellow eyes and jumped down from the bathroom cabinet. Did that mean he didn&#x2019;t believe me?</p><p>I put away the toothbrush and gave myself a last look in the mirror. Did I believe myself? What I said was true. I was definitely better prepared than I&#x2019;d been for the first two retreats. Wasn&#x2019;t I going to a meeting with my two workshop leaders this very morning to go over the final details?</p><p>But me putting on yarn retreats? It&#x2019;s not what I&#x2014;or anyone who knew me, especially my mother&#x2014;would have expected, given my rather spotty career history. A semester of law school was enough for me to know that being a lawyer wasn&#x2019;t for me. I&#x2019;d tried being a teacher, actually a substitute teacher at a private school. I did it for a couple of years and then I&#x2019;d had enough. I baked desserts at a bistro for six months. I would have stayed longer but the place went out of business. Then there was the temp work. At least it wasn&#x2019;t boring. I gave out samples of new products on street corners in downtown Chicago and spritzed perfume on shoppers in several department stores. The best of the bunch was my time at the detective agency, where I was either an assistant detective or detective&#x2019;s assistant, depending on who you were talking to. If you were talking to me, the title would definitely be assistant detective. Mostly what I did was phone interviews, but I loved it. Everything might have been different if my boss, Frank, had been able to keep me on.</p><p>But you can&#x2019;t change the past. So in an effort to make a fresh start&#x2014;that means when the temp work dried up, I&#x2019;d had to move back to my parents&#x2019; apartment in the Hancock Building and I needed to get out of there&#x2014;l had relocated to my aunt Joan&#x2019;s guest house almost two thousand miles away on the edge of California&#x2019;s Monterey Peninsula. In no time, my aunt had helped me line up a gig baking desserts for a local restaurant called the Blue Door and making muffins for the assorted coffee spots in town. With the chilly temperatures and almost constant cloudy skies, coffee spots were big in Cadbury by the Sea.</p><p>So how did I end up putting on yarn retreats? Yarn2Go was my aunt&#x2019;s business, but just months after I&#x2019;d moved into her guest house, she was killed in a hit-and-run accident. She left everything to me, including her business.</p><p>The next question is usually, what is a yarn retreat? The yarn part refers to a yarn craft, which so far has been knitting. I can practically see my mother&#x2019;s eyes flying upward at the thought. She&#x2019;s a cardiologist and it&#x2019;s pretty clear she thinks this apple has fallen very far from the tree. Her favorite line seems to be &#x201c;When I was your age [35], I was a doctor, a wife and a mother, and you&#x2019;re what?&#x201d; It helps her case that until I inherited the business, I didn&#x2019;t know which end of a knitting needle was up.</p><p>Now after two retreats, I definitely know about knitting needles. Mostly that I don&#x2019;t really like the ones that are long and come in pairs. It&#x2019;s circular needles all the way for me. And although I can&#x2019;t knit as well as the retreaters, I&#x2019;m holding my own and have samples of my work to prove it. And every time I finish something, I e-mail a picture to my mother. Yes, I might have an issue with proving that I can stick with something and finish it.</p><p>And it might be obvious I have a few issues with my mother. On the other hand, there is my father. He&#x2019;s a pediatrician and much easier to get along with. Of course, that could be because his patients are still in their formative years and he looks at me in the same way.</p><p>That covers the yarn part of the business. Now for the retreat part. It&#x2019;s really a vacation with a purpose. My group gets to learn something new, and has lots of time to hang out with other yarn lovers while they all work on their craft. They also get to enjoy the other activities put on by Vista Del Mar, the hotel and conference center where the retreats are held, conveniently located across the street from where I live.</p><p>But back to the present. Julius looked up at me from the floor. The cat kept surprising me, but then he was the first pet I had ever had. It had been all his decision. I had seen him around the neighborhood, but one day he showed up at my door and invited himself in. Did that make me his pet?</p><p>My impression of cats pre-Julius was that they were aloof and didn&#x2019;t really have a lot of interaction with their humans. Julius had made his presence felt from day one, and as the weeks had turned into months, he&#x2019;d become my shadow when I was home.</p><p>He followed me into the room my aunt had used as an office. It had taken me a while, but I had moved into the main house. <i>Main house</i> sounds a lot grander than it is. For that matter, <i>guest house</i> does, too. The guest house was actually a converted garage, and the main house had just two bedrooms, one of which was this office.</p><p>My aunt&#x2019;s creations were all over the little room. My favorite was the crocheted lion that guarded the desk. Julius jumped up on the small love seat and curled up against another of my aunt&#x2019;s creations, a granny square afghan. How lucky that the bright colors were in the middle of the motifs with rows of black yarn around the edges. All that black yarn camouflaged the cat hairs Julius so generously deposited. He watched as I picked up the red tote bag with <i>Yarn2Go Retreats</i> emblazoned on the front. This bag and its contents were a sample for the upcoming retreat. I emptied the contents to look them over once again. There were several large skeins of yarn and then a number of smaller balls of yarn. All of them were in different colors and textures. A small plastic bag came out as well. It contained an assortment of beads and charms.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re calling this retreat Mystery Bags,&#x201d; I said in case Julius was interested. The plan was that each bag would have a different selection of yarn and embellishments. I put everything back into the red tote thinking about the upcoming meeting with my helpers to go over the plan for the projects. A large manila envelope fell off the desk as I picked up the tote bag.</p><p>I stared at it on the floor for a moment before retrieving it. I was about to put it back where it had been, but then I stopped and emptied the contents on the dark wood desk.</p><p>How many times had I emptied this envelope, looked at the contents and wondered what to do? The photo of the infant with a teddy bear was old and the colors faded, but I was certain the baby was a girl by the bow in her wisps of hair. A small white envelope had <i>Edmund&#x2019;s Hair</i> written across the front. Inside there was a clump of shiny dark hair with the roots still attached. Another much older envelope that had been sealed and opened had <i>Our Baby</i> written in faded ink. At the bottom <i>Mother&#x2019;s DNA</i> was written in fresh ink, no doubt referring to traces left when the envelope was licked to seal. And last was the ledger sheet from the long-closed Cadbury Bank. It was marked as a sign-in sheet to access safety-deposit boxes. What made it noteworthy was the fact that Edmund Delacorte had signed in for Box 273, and then a few lines down Mary Jones had signed in to access the same number.</p><p>&#x201c;It was a money drop,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It was a way for Edmund Delacorte to pay off his baby mama.&#x201d; I chuckled at the term that was so contemporary and would have sounded so odd on July 25, 1962, when this list was created. &#x201c;Or at least I think it was.&#x201d;</p><p>Why did this matter all these years later? First you had to understand that the Delacorte family was like the royal family of Cadbury by the Sea. They had owned fishing boats, a cannery and a lot of land. Edmund Delacorte had been the sole owner of Vista Del Mar. He was married with a son when he died a couple of years after the date on the ledger sheet. His will had been very specific that Vista Del Mar was to go to his children. Barely a year after he died, his wife and son were killed in an accident. The hotel and conference center went back into the family pot. But if Edmund had fathered another child, she might be able to claim Vista Del Mar was hers as well as a portion of the family fortune.</p><p>I had no birth date, but it seemed likely that the baby in the photograph was now in her mid-fifties. I thought that I could track down the mother. I checked the Cadbury census records, which were definitely old school, and found several women named Mary Jones. The problem was that their ages didn&#x2019;t fit with the age of the mother of the heir. I had even discreetly tried to find an employee from the long-closed bank who might have a memory of the woman. I already knew Edmund made his deposits just before the regular staff went to lunch, no doubt realizing there would be a rotating group who filled in during the lunch break, when his mistress came to pick up her money.</p><p>It was more than fifty years ago and the one former bank employee I had been able to locate had a foggy memory of someone coming in during lunchtime, but the woman always wore a big hat and sunglasses.</p><p>Julius gave me a look of reproach. Was he wondering what I was doing with the envelope anyway? The appearance of an heir would stir everything up. Did the Delacorte sisters want to find out they had to share their fortune with their brother&#x2019;s love child and relinquish the ownership of Vista Del Mar? The answer to that was easy, no. What about the rest of the town? They seemed to resist change, so I imagine they would probably prefer to leave things as they were. Maybe it was because I was new to the town and wasn&#x2019;t so concerned with keeping the status quo, but I thought Edmund&#x2019;s secret baby deserved the chance to get what her father rightfully left her. Even if I had hit a dead end.</p><p>&#x201c;You are the only one who knows about this.&#x201d; I sat down on the small leather couch and stroked his neck. He leaned into my touch and began to purr. This living with a cat was an unfolding mystery. His displays of affection still surprised and touched me. &#x201c;Well, at least I know you won&#x2019;t go blabbing to anyone.&#x201d;</p><p>He climbed into my lap and left a dusting of his short black hairs on my dark-wash jeans. &#x201c;Mary Jones,&#x201d; I said with a disbelieving shake of my head. &#x201c;Obviously it&#x2019;s a fake name.&#x201d; Julius looked up at me as if to concur.</p><p>&#x201c;This is where my experience working at the detective agency comes in handy.&#x201d; Was the cat rolling his eyes now? Could cats even roll their eyes? &#x201c;Okay so maybe I only did phone interviews and occasionally stood in for surveillance, but my boss, Frank, said more than once that when people used fake names, the initials were usually real. So all I have to do is find the right woman with the initials <i>M.J. </i>and hope she&#x2019;ll lead me to her daughter. That really narrows it down, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I punctuated my comment with a hopeless shrug.</p><p>Julius decided he&#x2019;d had enough affection. He abruptly stood up and stretched, pressing his paws into my thigh before he jumped down. He looked back over his shoulder at me and blinked. Was that the cat way of saying a sarcastic &#x201c;Good luck&#x201d;?</p><p>Who knew if this M.J. was even still alive? She&#x2019;d be in her seventies by now, and maybe she didn&#x2019;t want the world to know about her indiscretion. Without her, there was no way to know what the baby&#x2019;s name was, and all the DNA meant nothing. Why was I even bothering with it? Maybe everybody was right. Maybe it should be left under the rug.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m talking to a cat,&#x201d; I said out loud in disbelief, throwing up my hands. Not that Julius noticed. With his tail held high, he walked out the office door and into the hall. I didn&#x2019;t have to be a cat specialist to know where he was headed&#x2014;the kitchen with hopes of a breakfast of stink fish.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>The phone was ringing when I shut the door a little while later. I knew it was my mother and deliberately left without picking it up. Thankfully, she never called me on my cell phone, too afraid I&#x2019;d be driving when I answered. Poor Julius looked a little forlorn as he sat in the window. Instead of his favorite smelly fish, he&#x2019;d had to settle for tastes from my container of yogurt. You&#x2019;d think he&#x2019;d appreciate that I was broadening his food horizons.</p><p>My yellow Mini Cooper was parked in the driveway next to the converted garage that had once been my home. I had stayed living there for months after my aunt died, feeling strange about moving into her house. But finally I had accepted that she would want me to have the place and I had moved in. I was glad for all the space and now I just used the guest house to store the supplies for the retreat. As expected, the sky was white. By now I had come up with various descriptions of the exact level of cloudiness. This morning&#x2019;s was the standard issue. Flat opaque whiteness, no shadows, and light that would look the same all day.</p><p>My house was on the edge of the small town, but even so, I was in downtown Cadbury in about five minutes. The fact there was never much traffic helped.</p><p>I had put on two retreats so far and learned a lot in the process. I now knew I couldn&#x2019;t run the retreats on my own; I needed to be very familiar with the program and to be prepared for any disaster that might happen. In the past that had included murder. The meeting I was on my way to was part of my plan to be hyperprepared this time. No longer would I depend on only one person to handle the workshops. Now I was going to have two people, Crystal Smith and Wanda Krug, and I was going to make sure I understood the process as well.</p><p>I usually met Crystal Smith at Cadbury Yarn, the store she ran with her mother, Gwen Selwyn. But today since Wanda was going to be there, too, we&#x2019;d decided to avoid all the activity at the store and meet at Crystal&#x2019;s house. Well, not exactly her house. It was really her mother&#x2019;s house, just like the yarn store was really her mother&#x2019;s business.</p><p>I found a parking spot on Grand Street, which was the main drag in town, and walked down a side street that sloped toward the water. Cadbury by the Sea was located on the tip of the Monterey Peninsula, and the ocean was visible from just about everywhere. In this part of town the houses were more like small cottages and were on top of each other with barely any yard. It made me grateful for the space around my place. The only open space was a small park with a beautiful old Monterey cypress tree. The foliage was a dark water retaining shade of green, and like all of them, the wind had shaped its branches into a graceful horizontal pose.</p><p>I had never been to Crystal&#x2019;s house before and had to check the house numbers as I walked down the street. The houses were a mixture of styles, pastel painted small Victorians, Craftsman bungalows with long front porches and Spanish cottages with large arched windows and red tiled roofs. There was no strip of grass between the sidewalk and street, making the houses seem very close to the narrow roadway.</p><p>Crystal&#x2019;s address matched up with a sweet-looking dusty blue Victorian on a corner. It wasn&#x2019;t like the large grand old Victorians on appropriately named Grand Street. They took up who...</p></p><h2>A Couple&#39;s Guide to Happy Retirement: For Better or For Worse . . .

He lives in Paris and Tirana.From outside came sounds of holiday music, bustling crowds and shuffling feet &#x2013; the special medley of a mass of �people on their way to the start of a parade. <br><br>For perhaps the tenth time in a row, I cautiously pulled the curtain aside. There had been no change in what was to be seen in the street: a slow-moving eddy in the human flood streaming �toward the center of town. Borne on its waves were placards, bouquets of flowers, and portraits of members of the Politburo, just like the ones we saw last year. The politicians&#x2019; faces looked even more stilted than usual as they jiggled along above the thronging mass of heads and arms. A slip of a placard-bearer&#x2019;s hand sometimes made the painted portraits seem to cast oblique and threatening glances. But even when they came face-to-face, not one of them gave a sign of recognizing any other.<br><br>I let go of the curtain and realized that I still had the invitation gripped tightly in my hand. It was the first time I had been entitled to sit in the grandstand at the May Day parade, and I still �could not quite believe that it �really was my own name written on the card. When I first received it, the Party secretary seemed as stunned as I was. It �wouldn&#x2019;t be fair to say that the only emotion in his eyes was that of envy: there was also stupefaction. To some extent, that was perfectly justifiable. I �wasn&#x2019;t the kind of person who was usually seen at presidium meetings or invited to sit in the stands at public celebrations. Even if (as I later learned) the vice-secretary himself had put my name forward when requested by the local Party committee to suggest �people beyond those who came up �every year, he was still astonished by the result. Although he had proposed my name, he probably never expected his new list would be approved. &#x201c;They always ask us for new names,&#x201d; he must have thought, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s always the same ones who get invited in the end.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Congratulations, congratulations,&#x201d; he hissed as he gave me the card, but at the very moment he handed it over, his eyes seemed to me to express something beyond envy and surprise. It hovered within the smile that gave it life, yet it was something separate and different. The right word for it might have been connivance. In short, it was an intense, interrogative, and rather sly smile, but sly in that particular well-meaning manner that arises between �people who share some secret involvement. His smile seemed to be saying: &#x201c;This invitation �didn&#x2019;t fall off a tree, did it, pal? What job did you do to earn the reward? But who cares anyway! Congratulations, my boy!&#x201d;<br><br>It was so crass I felt myself blush. All the way home, I �could not throw off a guilty feeling, as I wondered over and over again: he must be right, but what <i>did</i> I do to earn this invitation?<br><br>Isolated from the hubbub on the street, the apartment seemed even more silent than usual. Silent and empty. Everyone had left for the starting point of the parade, and my own steps, far from filling the space of the apartment, only emphasized how silent and empty it was. Even the silence and the emptiness had a peculiar quality, as did every�thing else on a day of that kind.<br><br>I was waiting for Suzana. However, the feeling that had burrowed into my chest was not remotely like the anxiety customarily associated with waiting for a woman. It was much more crushing, and no doubt heightened by the music and the unending, exhausting commotion rising from the street. I almost thought that one of the portraits would end up detaching itself from its bearer, then float up to my window, and look inside with its painted frozen stare, and say: &#x201c;And what are you doing up here? Aha! So that&#x2019;s the reason! You&#x2019;ve relinquished your place down there on the reviewing stand to wait for a woman, �haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If I&#x2019;m not there by half past eight, don&#x2019;t wait for me,&#x201d; Suzana had said.<br><br>Each time those words came into my mind my eyes glided inexorably �toward the couch where our last conversation had taken place. It had been infinitely sad. She&#x2019;d been half-undressed, and her words had come out the same way &#x2013; in shreds, with only half their meaning. It was getting harder and harder for her to see me, she said. Papa&#x2019;s career was on the rise . . . Their family was more than ever in the limelight . . . Two weeks before, at the last plenum of the Central Committee, Papa had gone up another rung . . . So it was obvious she would have to make changes to her way of life, to her wardrobe, to the �people she saw. Otherwise she might hurt his career.<br><br>&#x201c;Was it he who asked you for that&#x201d; &#x2013; I still �didn&#x2019;t know what to call that &#x2013; &#x201c;or did you decide for yourself?&#x201d;<br><br>She looked me in the eyes. &#x201c;He did,&#x201d; she answered after a pause. &#x201c;But . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When he explained it all to me, I saw his point of view.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br><br>I thought my eyes must have gone bloodshot, as if someone had thrown sand in my face. Guiltily, she laid her head on my shoulder. She ruffled the hair on the nape of my neck with cold fingers that felt as jagged as broken test tubes.<br><br>But why? I wanted to protest. Why just you? The children of the others make the most of it, and lead freer lives, with cars and parties at their villas by the shore . . . I surely would have remonstrated with her along those lines if she �hadn&#x2019;t brought up the issue herself. The others usually let their children enjoy more freedom, but her father . . . he �really was a different kind of person. Who �could tell what was going through his mind? Or was he, on the contrary, completely consistent, and was that not a principle to which he �could not allow himself to make an exception? Anyway, if he was standing to the right of the Guide at the First of May parade, it would be all over between us.<br><br>I said nothing, and she thought I �hadn&#x2019;t quite understood. &#x201c;Please understand,&#x201d; she sobbed. Given the state of public opinion, her father �could not comprehend her having an affair with a young man who was practically engaged to somebody else. Word would leak out, eventually. Especially now, don&#x2019;t you see? It �could not fail to.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Napoleonic Wars, 1803-1815</h2><p>Known collectively as the &#39;Great War&#39;, for over a decade the Napoleonic Wars engulfed not only a whole continent but also the overseas possessions of the leading European states. A war of unprecedented scale and intensity, it was in many ways a product of change that acted as a catalyst for upheaval and reform across much of Europe, with aspects of its legacy lingering to this very day. There is a mass of literature on Napoleon and his times, yet there are only a handful of scholarly works that seek to cover the Napoleonic Wars in their entirety, and fewer still that place the conflict in any broader framework. This study redresses the balance. Drawing on recent findings and applying a &#39;total&#39; history approach, it explores the causes and effects of the conflict, and places it in the context of the evolution of modern warfare. It reappraises the most significant and controversial military ventures, including the war at sea and Napoleon&#39;s campaigns of 1805-9. The study gives an insight into the factors that shaped the war, setting the struggle in its wider economic, cultural, political and intellectual dimensions.</p><p>David Gates, Deputy Director, Centre for Defence and International Security Studies, University of Lancaster.<br>"This is a compact, stimulating, and at times surprisingly polemical account."--<em>The International History Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Fluffy Meets The Tooth Fairy (level 3) (Hello Reader)</h2><p>Fluffy saves the day and meets a very important person in this fun new adventure about everyone's favorite classroom guinea pig!<br><br>Is the tooth fairy real?

What he really wants most is to go to Author Camp. But to get his parents' permission he's going to have to pass his math class, which has a probability of 0. THAT much he can understand! To make matters worse, he's been playing fast and loose with the truth: "I LOVE math" he tells his parents. "I've entered a citywide math contest!" he tells his teacher. "We're going to author camp!" he tells his best friend, Kelly. And now, somehow, he's going to have to make good on his promises.<br>Hilariously it's the "Fibonacci Sequence" -- a famous mathematical formula! -- that comes to the rescue, inspiring Gregory to create a whole new form of poem: the Fib! Maybe Fibs will save the day, and help Gregory find his way back to the truth.<br>For every kid who equates math with torture but wants his own way to shine, here's a novel that is way more than the sum of its parts.</p><p>Greg Pincus is a children&#39;s poet and novelist, a screenwriter, a former volunteer elementary school librarian, and a social media strategist.

There&#x2019;s a lot of space for this book to open up cross-curricular opportunities in math and literature, and it might also spark interesting book club conversations about how to deal with families whose interests diverge drastically from our own." -- <i>Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</i><br><br>"Dialogue and humor carry the third-person narrative along swiftly, and the characters are appealing. It is unusual to meet a family in middle-grade fiction that enjoys playing math games at the table, and it&#x2019;s refreshing to be reminded of the importance of honesty with family and friends. By any reckoning, a successful debut." -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br><br><br><b><i>Booklist </i>Reviews<br></b>Math-hater Gregory tries very hard to fit in with his math-loving family, even though what he really enjoys is writing and sharing poetry with his best friend, Kelly. His failing math scores mean that he has to spend summer at math camp, ruining his plans to spend the summer at author camp with Kelly. Still trying to find a way out, Gregory begins telling fibs to make those around him think that math camp is, indeed, the plan, and the ensuing mayhem caused by multiple fibs creates enough action and intrigue to keep readers fully engaged. The solution to Gregory&#x2019;s dilemma involves poetry designed using the Fibonacci sequence, and each chapter heading is a Fibonacci-sequence poem that forecasts Gregory&#x2019;s fibs. This delightful novel introduces a resourceful and inspiring young character, and many readers will relate to Gregory&#x2019;s desire for creative expression and his yearning for acceptance.<br><br><i><b>Publishers </b></i><b>Weekly Reviews<br></b>Everyone in Gregory's family adores math&#x2014;everyone, that is, except Gregory. While his parents and siblings live for the yearly City Math contest, Gregory prefers writing, especially poetry. Gregory has promised his best friend Kelly that he will attend Author Camp with her, despite not having asked his parents. When his math teacher announces that Gregory may fail math, it might as well be the fall of Rome as far as Gregory's parents are concerned&#x2014;and it results in Gregory constructing an outrageous lie that threatens to backfire. Gregory is a buoyant narrator whose extreme math phobia and obsessive love of pie (and definitely not pi) give his character an idiosyncratic shine. Hyperbolic details, like his mother's "Weird Wednesday" family dinners, are interspersed with passages from Gregory's extra credit math journal, where his ruminations on the Fibonacci sequence and "Fib poetry" give readers access to deeper reflections on mathematics, metaphor, and the places where they might overlap. Pincus's story explores struggles with friends, family, and learning while remaining exuberant and relatable, a winning equation.</p><h2>Summer Breeze: A Novel</h2><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Nancy Thayer never fails to imbue her novels with warmth and wisdom. In <i>Summer Breeze, </i>the author of <i>Beachcombers</i> and <i>Heat Wave</i> tells the wonderfully moving story of three women who forge a unique bond one sun-drenched summer on New England&#x2019;s Dragonfly Lake.<br> &nbsp;<br> Morgan O&#x2019;Keefe feels trapped in a gilded cage. True, the thirty-year-old mother agreed to put her science career on hold to raise her young son while her husband&nbsp; pursued his high-powered job. But though Morgan loves many things about staying home with her child, she misses the thrill of working with her colleagues in the lab. She&#x2019;s restless and in dire need of a change.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fed up with New York City&#x2019;s hectic pace, Natalie Reynolds takes up her aunt&#x2019;s offer to move to the Berkshires and house-sit her fabulous lakeside house for a year. Passionate about applying brush to canvas, Natalie is poised to become the artist she has forever longed to be. But life on Dragonfly Lake is never without surprises, and for a novice swimmer like Natalie, the most welcome surprise proves to be the arms of a handsome neighbor pulling her up from the water for a gulp of air.<br> &nbsp;<br> When her mother breaks her leg, Bella Barnaby quits her job in Austin and returns home to help out her large, boisterous family. Among her new duties: manning the counter at the family business, Barnaby&#x2019;s Barn, an outdated shop sorely in need of a makeover. While attractive architect Aaron has designs on her, Bella harbors long held secret dreams of her own.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Summer on Dragonfly Lake is ripe for romance, temptation, and self-discovery as the lives of these three women unexpectedly intertwine. <i>Summer Breeze</i> illustrates how the best of friends can offer comfort, infuriate, or even&#x2014;sometimes&#x2014;open one&#x2019;s eyes to the astonishing possibilities of life lived in a different way. This captivating novel displays a prestigiously gifted writer at the height of her storytelling powers.</p><p><b>Nancy Thayer </b>is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Heat Wave, Beachcombers, Summer House, Moon Shell Beach, </i>and <i>The Hot Flash Club</i>. She lives in Nantucket.1<br><br>When Aaron&#x2019;s Volvo pulled up to the curb of the Barnaby house, Bella felt just a bit giddy.<br>She&#x2019;d met Aaron Waterhouse in December, right after she&#x2019;d returned home to Dragonfly Lake to help her mother, and the connection had been instantaneous and electric.<br>Aaron was handsome, sweet, sexy, and smart. He was the first man she&#x2019;d ever wanted to marry. While Bella was growing up, her own family had been happy&#x2014;noisy and messy, but happy&#x2014;and Bella wanted one like that for herself. Lots of children, toys on the floor, flour on the kitchen counter while she taught her son or daughter to make popovers (so much fun for children), a husband who would come home from work with a smile on his face to toss his children into the air&#x2014;and who could make her melt at the sight of him, the way she was melting now.<br>She could have all that with Aaron. He had just gotten his master&#x2019;s in architecture. He was putting out feelers for jobs and was sure to get a good one. He was so bright, so reliable. He wanted children. He was in love with her. She was in love with him, and the vision of their life together was enticing.<br>But there was one enormous problem: Aaron had been invited to interview for a job in San Francisco.<br>San Francisco excited Aaron. Bella didn&#x2019;t want to leave Massachusetts.<br>She&#x2019;d left already, plenty of times. She&#x2019;d seen foreign places.<br>&nbsp;<br>She&#x2019;d traveled to Paris, to Italy, to Amsterdam. She&#x2019;d lived in Utah and in Texas.<br>Now she wanted to get started with her own real life. She wanted to live here, near Dragonfly Lake, a world she knew and cherished. It wasn&#x2019;t just the landscape and the closeness of her family. It was more than that&#x2014;it was as if she were falling in love with a new vision of herself, as if at twenty-seven a mist were evaporating from a mirror, allowing her true image to show clear.<br>It was early June. Bella and Aaron had been together for five months, growing closer every day. She was pretty sure Aaron was about to propose to her. And she didn&#x2019;t know what her answer would be.<br>&#x201c;Bell!&#x201d; Her older brother, Ben, stuck his head into the living room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m driving down to the Hortons&#x2019; with our beach chairs and the food.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Bella answered. &#x201c;Aaron and I will walk down.&#x201d;<br>Ben went out the door and headed to his Jeep Cherokee, with its four-wheel drive, good for the snowy months, and its back hatch, good for carrying lots of stuff. Ben was practical, scientific, and methodical. He had a PhD and a tenured position at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. His life revolved in a precise circle like planets orbiting the sun.<br>Bella&#x2019;s life felt more like a Slinky flopping down the stairs.<br>She grinned at her own joke. At least she still had her sense of humor. You couldn&#x2019;t live in a family of four Barnaby children, all with a first name that began with the letter B, without developing a sense of humor. And she was happy, and an optimist, glad to be home, full of hope for the future. Her life wasn&#x2019;t tragic. Just a puzzle.<br>Bella had spent the last two and a half years teaching third grade<br>in Austin, Texas, until last Christmas, when her mother, while trying to put the angel on top of the tree, fell off the ladder and broke her leg. Bella&#x2019;s father taught high school English five days a week. Bella&#x2019;s older sister, Beatrice, was busy in her house an hour away with her three little children. Ben, of course, had his own apartment in Amherst, his students, and lab. Seventeen-year-old Brady was still in high school. So Bella abbreviated her contract, left Austin after the first semester, and flew home to take over her mother&#x2019;s shop and help around the house.<br>She was surprised to discover she didn&#x2019;t miss teaching. She was exhilarated to be back home, which for her was not just the comfortable house she&#x2019;d grown up in on a lake surrounded by woodland, but the entire region where forests and farmlands stretched like a vast Eden on either side of the wide Connecticut River. This area boasted five of the best colleges in the world, drawing students and faculty from all over the planet.<br>As a child, she&#x2019;d hiked with her family up Mount Hadley and Mount Tom, and canoed on the Connecticut River. She&#x2019;d visited Emily Dickinson&#x2019;s house several times, and heard Billy Collins speak when he was the country&#x2019;s poet laureate. She&#x2019;d contemplated modern sculpture at the art museums, and she&#x2019;d witnessed a four-point stag, branched with heavy antlers, step over their lawn and down to the lake to drink in the early-morning light.<br>She loved this area, her family, their house . . . and that was part of the problem. Perhaps she loved them too much.<br>Now, as she watched, Aaron stepped out of his Volvo. He waved at Ben as Ben backed the Cherokee out of the drive. Aaron had incredibly muscled arms and thighs, an aftereffect of wrestling in high school and college. She loved the heft of them, the safety she felt in his arms. He had dark, curly hair and wore glasses over his hazel eyes. He was her Superman, looking academic, restraining so much strength and sexuality.<br>He approached the house, tapped on the front door, and let himself in, as everyone did who knew the Barnabys well.<br>&#x201c;Hi, Aaron.&#x201d; &#x201c;Hey, Bella.&#x201d;<br>Just the sight of him made her short of breath. He pulled her to him and kissed her thoroughly.<br>She gently pushed him away. &#x201c;We should go.&#x201d; &#x201c;Right. I brought some wine. It&#x2019;s in the car.&#x201d;<br>Together they left the house, picked up the bottles of Pinot, and began walking along the narrow road winding around Dragonfly Lake. The lake was tucked in a hollow snuggled up against a gently rising mountain, or what was called a mountain in New England; in Colorado, it would be downsized to hill. It rose to a ridge running north and south, covered with evergreens, birches, and oaks, home to deer, porcupines, foxes, and numerous other creatures, including the clever raccoons that made human lives miserable if they didn&#x2019;t use the proper tight-locking trash receptacles. Various styles of houses surrounded the lake: A-frames, modernized log cabins, seventies split-levels like the Barnabys&#x2019; house, and a few fabulous minimansions like the ones on either side of the Barnabys&#x2019;.<br>All the homes looked out onto the lake, which curved in a capricious blue oval around the hill, its banks thick with grasses, forest, and wildflowers. Much of the shore was dotted with boathouses and docks, because the lake was big enough to sail on. Here and there, man-made beaches of golden sand sloped to the water. Everywhere there were trees, and over the lawns and road, the sweet green leaves of spring were casting the first delicate shadows. Tulips opened their petals to the light; pansies spilled from window boxes.<br>Aaron inhaled a deep breath of air. &#x201c;Nice day for a cookout.&#x201d; Bella nodded. &#x201c;Mmm.

A straight, slender nose, neat ears, a long face with a firm jaw. Wrinkles at the corners of the eyes and across the forehead, not, she figured, from laughing but from thinking. Here in the five-college area, lots of people thought for a living. The man was perhaps thirty.

It has come to reflect the broad historical experiences of the modern Middle East. <i>Beware of Small States</i> is an elegant and incisive history of Lebanon culminating with the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah and its aftermath. David Hirst&#x2014;a former Middle East correspondent for <i>The Guardian</i>, whose tough, skeptical voice has earned him death threats and seen him banned from six Arab countries&#x2014;crafts a narrative that is essential for anyone wishing to understand the current political climate of the Middle East.</p><p><b>David Hirst</b> was for many years the Middle Eastern correspondent of <i>The Guardian</i>. His seminal book on the Arab-Israeli conflict, <i>The Gun and the Olive Branch</i>, was published in 1977 and in a massively updated new edition in 2003. He has been banned from six Arab countries and kidnapped twice in the course of his distinguished career. He writes regularly for <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Toronto Globe and Mail</i>, <i>Daily Star</i> (Lebanon), <i>Al-Ahram</i> (Egypt). He divides his time between Lebanon and Cyprus.A former Middle Eastern correspondent for the <i>Guardian</i>, Hirst (<i>The Gun and the Olive Branch</i>) chronicles the travails of modern Lebanon in this provocative polemic that doubles as a history of the Arab-Israeli struggle. Given Lebanon's tiny size, sectarian polity, and strategic location in a volatile region, Hirst observes that it was almost designed to be the everlasting battleground for others' political, strategic and ideological conflicts. Lebanon's role in the struggle for Palestine, however, is the author's primary interest. Displaced Palestinians flooded into southern Lebanon following the first Arab-Israeli War (1948) and spawned a guerilla 'state-within-a-state' on Israel's northern border. Hirst is solidly in the Palestinians' corner throughout; he inveighs against Israeli policies of ethnic cleansing and blocking progress toward a settlement of the Palestinian issue. The author also faults the United States for its deference to all things Israeli; takes to task Israel and the Israeli lobby in the U.S. for provoking the 2003 invasion of Iraq; and anoints the Iranians as the only true victor of America's war in Iraq. Hirst's is a passionately partisan and eloquent recounting of the tragic fate of modern Lebanon and the Palestinian people. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Often the shape of the rhyme reflects the action performed by the machine. For example, the bold, black print describing fire engines arcs and curves like the water splashing from the fireman's hose. Text about the bulldozer bumps across the page. "Bulldozers are good at push, push, pushing, over rough, bumpy ground, scraping and shoving." The verse on every page ends with the refrain, "They can work all day." Although not all of the rhymes are equally satisfying, they successfully move readers from page to page, truck to truck.

An inveterate gambler who coined the dictum "if your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough," Capa risked his life again and again, most dramatically as the only photographer landing with the first wave on Omaha Beach on D-Day, and he created some of the most enduring images ever made with a camera. <br><br>But the drama in Capa's life wasn't limited to one side of the lens. Born in Budapest as Andre Freidman, Capa fled political repression and anti-Semitism as a teenager by escaping to Berlin, where he first picked up a Leica and then witnessed the rise of Hitler. By the time his images of D-Day appeared in <i>Life Magazine</i>, he had become a legend, the first photographer to make his calling appear glamorous and sexy, and the model for many of the most intrepid photographers to this day. In 1947, after a decade covering war, he founded a cooperative agency-Magnum-and in the process revolutionized the industry. For the first time, photographers would retain their own copyrights and negatives, and nearly half a century later, Magnum remains the most prestigious agency of its kind. <br><br>By the time he died, at just forty-one in 1954, Capa was not only the greatest adventurer in photographic history. He had become a colleague and confidant to writers Irwin Shaw, John Steinbeck, and Ernest Hemingway and director John Huston, and a seducer of several of his era's most alluring icons, including Ingrid Bergman. <br><br>From Budapest in the twenties to Paris in the thirties, from post-war Hollywood to Stalin's Russia, and from New York in the fifties to Indochina, <i>Blood and Champagne</i> is a wonderfully evocative account of Capa's life and times. Based on extensive interviews with Capa's friends and contemporaries, as well as FBI and Soviet files and other previously unpublished materials, Alex Kershaw's biography is every bit as compelling as its charismatic subject. <br></p><p>"It does seem to me that Capa has proved beyond all doubt that the camera need not be a cold mechanical device," John Steinbeck wrote of photojournalist Robert Capa in a quote that launches this well-written, exhaustively researched biography. "Like the pen, it is as good as the man who uses it. It can be the extension of mind and heart." That&#x2019;s quite a compliment coming from an author like Steinbeck, but then Capa won the respect and friendship of some of the brightest talents of his generation; other admirers and poker buddies included Ernest Hemingway and John Huston, and among his many loves was actress Ingrid Bergman. Capa won fame slogging through the blood and grime to capture vivid images of five different wars, from the Spanish Civil War (where he wasn't above staging some of his photographs), through the landings at Omaha Beach on D-Day (which he chronicled for <i>Life</i> magazine as the only journalist to wade ashore with the first wave of G.I.s), to the early days of the Vietnam conflict (where he was killed in action at the age of 41 while covering the French army, soon to be replaced with disastrous results by the Americans). Born a Hungarian Jew named Andr� Friedmann, another great writer, John Hersey, famously dubbed the swarthy chain-smoking photographer "the Man Who Invented Himself," and author Alex Kershaw contends that one of his greatest achievements was the legend that he created for himself. A California journalist who contributes to <i>The Guardian</i> and <i>The Sunday Times Magazine</i>, among others, Kershaw brings Capa and his times to life with bright, vivid writing and telling anecdotes, using a fascinating personal odyssey to put the man's professional accomplishments in perspective. "Capa was the first photographer to make photojournalism appear glamorous and sexy," he writes. Of course, that distinction and all others take a back seat to the photos themselves, and this book&#x2019;s only shortcoming is that it does not include any examples of the great man&#x2019;s work.<i>--Jim DeRogatis</i>International Praise for Blood and Champagne: <p>"Ambition, integrity and courage were intertwined in Capa, as Alex Kershaw persuades in this elegant biography ...a spellbinding portrait of his gypsy life." <br>-Christopher Sylvester, Sunday Times (UK) </p><p>"A fine read, full of high emotion like watching Casablanca for the first time.

Try Kinky "Big Dick" Friedman, the fictional star of <i>The Mile High Club</i>, 1999's <i>Spanking Watson</i>, and 11 earlier amateur detective novels by the real-life musician-turned-novelist Kinky Friedman. As <i>The Mile High Club</i> opens, the Kinkster is holding forth with his gorgeous Middle Eastern seatmate, Khadija, on a flight from Dallas to New York City. As the plane begins its landing approach, Khadija rises to visit the loo, neither returning to her seat nor deplaning with the rest of the passengers. And Kinky's left holding her bag.<p> Unable to reach her and intrigued by several callers claiming that they, in fact, had Khadija's bag, Kinky and his real private-eye friend, Rambam, (Rambam, writer Mike McGovern and the Watson-like Ratso are the series's "Village Irregulars") jimmy open the bag to find, among other things, a vibrator.</p><p> </p><blockquote>"It has three gears apparently."<p> "Does it have four-wheel drive?"</p><p> "We have some slinky black lace panties, stockings, and lingerie."</p><p> "Many terrorists shop at Victoria's Secret."</p><p> "We have men's socks, undershirts, underwear."</p><p> "Boxers or briefs?"</p><p> "Extremely brief briefs. Khadija may be a little kinky. Pardon the expression."</p><p> "If that's all that's in there, what's the big fuss about? That's pretty much standard contents for most carryon luggage when the final destination is the Village."</p><p> "Yes, but they don't all include this," said Rambam, holding up a large plastic Baggie full of enough passports to make a customs agent put in for overtime.</p></blockquote><p> And so it jauntily goes until its nifty surprise ending. Here, as in earlier cases, the plot is marginal and intentionally laughable. It's the straight man, really, enabling Kinky's well-done paeans to Sherlock Holmes, Dashiell Hammett, and Raymond Chandler, his three-page dissertations on outdoor urination, ruminations on Talmudic proscriptions against indoor nail-clipping, and, most appreciably, his obvious facility and fascination with the language. <i>--Michael Hudson</i></p><b>Kinky Friedman</b> lives with two cats, three dogs, a pet armadillo, a much-used Smith-Corona typewriter, and countless Monte Cristo #2 cigar butts on a ranch in the Texas hill country. <p> To order the Kinkster's new live CD, <i>Classic Snatches from Europe,</i> with Little Jewford, call (713) 521-7700, or go online at www.sphincterrecords.com.</p></p><h2>Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>Doing Documentary Work (New York Public Library Lectures in Humanities)</h2><p>Sitting in his study, William Carlos Williams once revealed to Robert Coles what he considered to be his greatest problem in writing a documentary about his patients in New Jersey. "When Im <em>there</em>, sitting with those folks, listening and talking," he said to Coles, "I'm part of that life, and I'm near it in my head, too.... Back <em>here</em>, sitting near this typewriter--its different. I'm a writer. I'm a doctor living in Rutherford who is describing 'a world elsewhere.'" Williams captured the great difficulty in documentary writing--the gulf that separates the reality of the subject from the point of view of the observer .<br> Now, in this thought-provoking volume, the renowned child psychiatrist Robert Coles, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>Children in Crisis</em> series, offers a penetrating look into the nature of documentary work. Utilizing the documentaries of writers, photographers, and others, Coles shows how their prose and pictures are influenced by the <em>observers</em> frame of reference: their social and educational background, personal morals, and political beliefs. He discusses literary documentaries: James Agee's searching portrait of Depression-era tenant farmers, <em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em>, and George Orwell's passionate description of England's coal-miners, <em>The Road to Wigan Pier</em>. Like many documentarians, Coles argues, Agee and Orwell did not try to be objective, but instead showered unadulterated praise on the "noble" poor and vituperative contempt on the more privileged classes (including themselves) for "exploiting" these workers. Documentary photographs could be equally revealing about the observer. Coles analyzes how famous photographers such as Walker Evans and Dorthea Lange edited and cropped their pictures to produce a desired effect. Even the shield of the camera could not hide the presence of the photographer. Coles also illuminates his points through his personal portraits of William Carlos Williams; Robert Moses, one of the leaders of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee during the 1960s; Erik H. Erikson, biographer of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther; and others. Documentary work, Coles concludes, is more a narrative constructed by the observer than a true slice of reality.<br> With the growth in popularity of films such as Ken Burns's <em>The Civil War</em> and the controversial basketball documentary <em>Hoop Dreams</em>, the question of what is "real" in documentary work is more pressing than ever. Through revealing discussions with documentarians and insightful analysis of their work, complemented by dramatic black-and-white photographs from Lange and Evans, <em>Doing Documentary Work</em> will provoke the reader into reconsidering how fine the line is between truth and fiction. It is an invaluable resource for students of the documentary and anyone interested in this important genre.</p><p>Robert Coles, a child psychiatrist whose series of books on children won him a Pulitzer Prize, has turned his watchful eye to the nature of the documentary and produced a thought-provoking book. In somewhat the manner of James Faris's recent study, <i>Navajo and Photography</i>, Coles reveals how documentarians like Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans edited and cropped their images to produce a desired effect, and raises the question of authenticity versus manipulation. Lange, the subject of a previous biographical study by Coles, comes under close scrutiny as he contrasts her iconic image of a migrant mother with obscure photographs shot moments earlier. The author also recalls James Agee's self-critical appraisal of his and Evans's "insensitivity" and "arrogance" in pursuing an editorial assignment.<br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Robert Coles, M.D.,</strong> is a child psychiatrist, and the James Agee Professor of Social Ethics Harvard University. He is a founding member of the Center of Documentary Studies at Duke University.

In the first story, Manchester Black and his superhero team--the Elite--announce a new world order in which heroism based on truth and justice is declared obsolete. The team will instead act immediately as judge, jury, and executioner. After reasoning with the new vigilantes fails, Superman plays hardball to put Black in his place without compromising the images of the hero and the leader. Well after Black's defeat, his sister Vera Lynn resurrects the Elite as a deep-cover team, vowing to play by the rules. Most team members have less-than-pristine pasts, yet Superman and the Justice League, though dubious of Elite espionage tactics, unofficially sanction it. Kelly's conception poses the piquant question, Can a superhero under deep cover and working with killers resist becoming a killer himself? Kelly presents the grays in his characters as well as their world with a realism that artwork distinguished by fluid, dynamic line work and bold inking crucially abets. <i>Tina Coleman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

There seems now to be no question too vast or too trivial. No longer reviled, curiosity is now celebrated.<br><br>By examining the rise of curiosity from the dawn of modern science to today, we can examine how it functions in science, how it is spun, packaged and sold, and how the changing shape of science influences the kinds of questions it may ask.</p><p><b>Philip Ball</b> is a freelance writer who lives in London. He worked for over twenty years as an editor for <i>Nature</i>, writes regularly in the scientific and popular media, and has authored many books on the interactions of the sciences, the arts, and the wider culture, including, most recently, <i>Serving the Reich: The Struggle for the Soul of Physics under Hitler</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press<i>.</i><br> &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>Curiosity</i> emerges as a first-rate popular account of how science in Europe began. Accurate, witty, and reliable, the book ably shows modern readers how we got to be modern.

Philip Ball wants to retain the excitement and fervor that drove scientific curiosity from the seventeenth century onwards and celebrate the &#x2018;love, the awe, the passion&#x2019; that scientists feel but repress in their research because of the curious history of scientific experimentation.

Almost everyone of importance between Copernicus and Newton is discussed here, and a great deal of information is imparted in a user-friendly and thought-provoking way.&#x201d; (<i>Telegraph</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A wonderfully nuanced and wise study of the scientific revolution. . . .

Ball traces the intellectual history of curiosity, from the Renaissance cabinets of curiosity to the Large Hadron Collider at CERN that harks back to a view of nature as holding secrets that must be teased out with experimental apparatuses. He shows how curiosity went from being seen as a vice in medieval Catholic Europe, to a shallow form of inquisitiveness that inspired learned societies like the London philosophical club, and then, in the latter half of the sixteenth century, got recast as a virtue. Changes in the notion of curiosity from vice to virtue, he argues, have gone hand in hand with the development of empirical methods in science.&#x201d; (<i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The book is well-documented and exciting, driving the reader to unexpected vistas. &nbsp;His clever approach to complex scientific concepts is hypnotizing, directing our intellectual selves to fresh ideas and new horizons. &nbsp;This book must be read and appreciated.&#x201d; (<i>San Francisco Book Review</i>)</p><h2>Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s Monster Museum</h2><p>An anthology of twelve monster stories by such well-known authors as Benet, Bixby, Sturgeon, and Bradbury</p><p></p><h2>The Stones of Venice (Classic History)</h2><p>&#39;Thank God I am here, it is a Paradise of Cities,&#39; Ruskin wrote on his second visit to Venice in 1841.

He is no stranger to recent confrontations at American universities. But where many see only the suppression of free speech, the babying of students, and the drive to bury the imperfect parts of our history, Kronman recognizes in these on-campus clashes a threat to our democracy.<br> <br> As Kronman argues in <i>The Assault on American Excellence</i>, the founders of our nation learned over three centuries ago that in order for this country to have a robust democratic government, its citizens have to be trained to have tough skins, to make up their own minds, and to win arguments not on the basis of emotion but because their side is closer to the truth. In other words, to prepare people to choose good leaders, you need to turn them into smart fighters, people who can take hits and think clearly so they&#x2019;re not manipulated by demagogues.<br> <br> Kronman is the first to tie today&#x2019;s campus debates back to the history of American values, drawing on luminaries like Alexis de Tocqueville and John Adams to show how these modern controversies threaten the best of our intellectual traditions. His tone is warm and optimistic, that of a humanist and a lover of the humanities who is passionate about educating students capable of living up to the demands of a thriving democracy.<br> <br> Incisive and wise, <i>The Assault on American Excellence </i>makes the radical argument that to graduate as good citizens, college students have to be tested in a system that isn&#x2019;t wholly focused on being good to them.</p><p>Anthony Kronman is a writer, lawyer, Sterling Professor of Law at Yale Law School, and a former dean of the Yale Law School from 1994&#x2013;2004. He is the author or coauthor of five books, including <i>The Assault on American Excellence</i>, <i>Education&#x2019;s End: Why Our Colleges and Universities Have Given Up on the Meaning of Life</i>, and <i>Confessions of a Born-Again Pagan</i>. Professor Kronman taught at the University of Minnesota Law School and the University of Chicago Law School before joining the Yale faculty. Outside of his academic obligations, Kronman served on the board of various non-profit organizations including the Foote School in New Haven, Yale University Press, and the Slifka Center for Jewish Life at Yale. He is a member of Council on Foreign Relations and a Fellow in the American Bar Foundation, the Connecticut Bar Foundation and American Academy of Arts and Sciences.&#x201c;The only way to begin any new endeavor is with a sense of excitement about life. In connection to that, Anthony Kronman has a bracing book on American higher education, its purposes and problems.&nbsp;Mr. Kronman, a professor and former dean at Yale Law School, observes the academy in which he's spent his career and doesn't like everything he sees.&nbsp;He is generally progressive yet opposes the leveling produced by the steamroller of prevalent political, cultural and educational attitudes.&nbsp;It is a rich book, densely argued.&nbsp;I want to call it a cry of the heart, but it's more like a cry of the brain, a calm and erudite one.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;&nbsp;</b><b>Peggy Noonan, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Today&#x2019;s students are not chafing under some bow-tied patriarchal WASP dispensation. Instead, they are the beneficiaries of a system put in place by professors and administrators whose political views are almost uniformly left-wing and whose campus policies indulge nearly every progressive orthodoxy.&nbsp;So why all the rage?&nbsp;The answer lies in the title of Anthony Kronman&#x2019;s necessary, humane and brave new book: <i>The Assault on American Excellence</i>.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014; Bret Stephens, <i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;What would happen if the academy lost its reverence for excellence and instead took on the virtues and methods of argumentation found in political life? Universities would lose their souls, as Anthony Kronman shows in this brilliant book. He weaves together legal and intellectual history, a humane concern for students, and a love of the life of the mind to diagnose the core confusion undermining the confidence and coherence of the academy. The book is beautifully written, it is erudite yet accessible, and it is essential for any discussion of the future of higher education&#x2014;or of liberal democracy.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014; Jonathan Haidt, Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership at New York University&#x2019;s Stern School of Business and&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling coauthor of&nbsp;<i>The Coddling of the American Mind</i>&nbsp;</b><br><br>&#x201c;As a new generation of college students gets ready to return to campus, I&#x2019;m reminded of the late Allan Bloom, the University of Chicago professor...

Greene Series)</h2><p>The Sutton-Taylor Feud of DeWitt, Gonzales, Karnes, and surrounding counties began shortly after the Civil War ended. The blood feud continued into the 1890s when the final court case was settled with a governmental pardon. Of all the Texas feuds, the one between the Sutton and Taylor forces lasted longer and covered more ground than any other. William E. Sutton was the only Sutton involved, but he had many friends to wage warfare against the large Taylor family. The causes are still shrouded in mystery and legend, as both sides argued they were just and right. In April 1868 Charles Taylor and James Sharp were shot down in Bastrop County, alleged horse thieves attempting to escape. During this period many men were killed "while attempting to escape." The killing on Christmas Eve 1868 of Buck Taylor and Dick Chisholm was perhaps the final spark that turned hard feelings into fighting with bullets and knives. William Sutton was involved in both killings. "Who sheds a Taylor's blood, by a Taylor's hand must fall" became a fact of life in South Texas. Violent acts between the two groups now followed. The military reacted against the killing of two of their soldiers in Mason County by Taylors. The State Police committed acts that were not condoned by their superiors in Austin. Mobs formed in Comanche County in retaliation for John Wesley Hardin's killing of a Brown County deputy sheriff. One mob "liberated" three prisoners from the DeWitt County jail, thoughtfully hanging them close to the cemetery for the convenience of their relatives. An ambush party killed James Cox, slashing his throat from ear to ear&#x2014;as if the buckshot in him was not sufficient. A doctor and his son were called from their home and brutally shot down. Texas Rangers attempted to quell the violence, but when they were called away, the killing began again. In this definitive study of the Sutton-Taylor Feud, Chuck Parsons demonstrates that the violence between the two sides was in the tradition of the family blood feud, similar to so many other nineteenth-century American feuds. His study is well augmented with numerous illustrations and appendices detailing the feudists, their attempts at treaties, and their victims.</p><p>CHUCK PARSONS was born and raised in Iowa and Minnesota. His books include John B. Armstrong: Texas Ranger, Pioneer Rancher; Texas Ranger N. O. Reynolds; Captain L. H. McNelly, Texas Ranger; Bowen and Hardin; Clay Allison: Portrait of a Shootist; and The Capture of John Wesley Hardin. Parsons is editor of the Wild West History Association Saddlebag.&#x201c;Pistoleer John Wesley Hardin provided the star power for the fandango, but the horrific violence and terror engendered by the Suttons and Taylors gave the feud a near mythic status that lives even today.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>True West</i> <br><br><br>&#x201c;This is nothing less than the definitive study of this classic Texas feud, which spanned three decades and took eighty lives.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Roundup Magazine</i> <br><br><br>&#x201c;The Suttons and Taylors were both victims and aggressors in a vicious cycle of violence and revenge. . . .

The very young often get their words wrong.). When a terrorist leader releases a necrophage bomb, it not only decimates Grime headquarters, it turns Pepper into the magical world&#x2019;s first fairy amputee&#x2014;but she&#x2019;s not going to let a little thing like a missing leg stop her. To catch her criminal, and prevent him from unleashing a VIURS in one of the human world&#x2019;s biggest shopping centers, West Edmonton Mall, she goes undercover as a human. But once Pepper's theories of humanity collide with the reality of bullies, cliques, and environmental destruction, will she still believe humanity's worth saving?</p><p>When Natasha was little, there was only one thing she wanted to be: a superhero.

When the Colonies needed a commander-in-chief to build an army, George did it. And when they needed his army to fight the British, George did it. But when Americans asked George to be the first president of the brand-new United States, he politely said,"NO, THANK YOU." Here is the whimsical story of how our first president tried to avoid his most important job. Filled with little-known and funny facts, this book reveals a more personal side of Washington&#x2014;a great leader who could also be a little nervous.</p></p><p>Larry Day is the award-winning illustrator of several picture books about American history, including <em>Colonial Voices: Hear them Speak</em> and <em>Voices from the Oregon Trail</em> by Kay Winters and <em>George Did It </em>by Suzanne Tripp Jurmain, He has exhibited watercolors extensively as well. He lives in Oak Park, Illinois.<br>*Starred Review* Gr. 2-4. Putting a human face on one of the most famously wooden figures in American history, this picture book focuses on George Washington as a reluctant first president. Though other books note that Washington was disinclined to leave the relative peace of Mount Vernon for the presidency, Jurmain adds that he felt too tired and too old at 57, that he did not want to live in New York, and that he was nervous about taking on the job. The lively text follows Washington as friends such as Jefferson convince him to accept the challenge, as the election is carried out (he was the only candidate), and as he travels to the inauguration with multiple parties along the way. The text is studded with short quotes and memorable details, such as cash-poor Washington borrowing 100 pounds to pay for his journey and the presence of two orangutans on one of the boats celebrating his arrival in New York Harbor. Brightened with watercolor washes, Day's strong drawings illustrate the story with wit and finesse. Though the presence of a fox in many of the scenes (stowing away atop the coach, sleeping in Washington's bedchamber, carrying a flag while riding on his horse) may lead some to wonder whether other elements are factual, this thoroughly engaging book has a great deal to offer young students of American history.

The effervescent wit and technical bravura of his songs are matched by their unguarded revelations of feeling. In the words of editor Robert Kimball, &#x201c;Porter wrote tellingly of the pain and evanescence of emotional relationships. He gently mocked propriety and said that few things were simple or lasting or free from ambiguity.&#x201d; Of the masters of twentieth-century American songwriting, Porter was one of the few who wrote both music and lyrics, and, even in the absence of his melodies, his words distill an unmistakable mixture of poignancy and wit that marks him as a genius of light verse.<br><br>Selected from over eight hundred songs, here are Porter&#x2019;s finest flights of invention, lyrics that are an indelible part of 20th-century culture: &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s Do It,&#x201d; &#x201c;Love for Sale,&#x201d; &#x201c;I Get a Kick Out of You,&#x201d; &#x201c;Anything Goes,&#x201d; &#x201c;In the Still of the Night,&#x201d; &#x201c;I Concentrate on You,&#x201d; and dozens more.<br><br><b>About the American Poets Project</b><br>Elegantly designed in compact editions, printed on acid-free paper, and textually authoritative, the American Poets Project makes available the full range of the American poetic accomplishment, selected and introduced by today&#x2019;s most discerning poets and critics.</p><p><b>Robert Kimball</b>&nbsp;is a historian of the American musical theater whose books include&nbsp;<i>The Gershwins</i>&nbsp;(with Alfred Simon),&nbsp;<i>Reminiscing with Sissle and Blake</i>&nbsp;(with William Bolcom),&nbsp;<i>Reading Lyrics</i>&nbsp;(with Robert Gottlieb), and volumes devoted to the complete lyrics of Lorenz Hart, Ira Gershwin, Irving Berlin, and Frank Loesser.

With profound insight and remarkable candor, Styron tracks the progress of his madness, from the smothering misery and exhaustion, to the agony of composing his own suicide note and his eventual, hard-won recovery. Illuminating an illness that affects millions but which remains widely misunderstood, this book is about the darkness of depression, but it is also ultimately about survival and redemption.</p><p>In 1985 William Styron fell victim to a crippling and almost suicidal depression, the same illness that took the lives of Randall Jarrell, Primo Levi and Virginia Woolf. That Styron survived his descent into madness is something of a miracle. That he manages to convey its tortuous progression and his eventual recovery with such candor and precision makes <b>Darkness Visible</b> a rare feat of literature, a book that will arouse a shock of recognition even in those readers who have been spared the suffering it describes.A work of great personal courage and a literary tour de force, this bestseller is Styron's true account of his descent into a crippling and almost suicidal depression. Styron is perhaps the first writer to convey the full terror of depression's psychic landscape, as well as the illuminating path to recovery.<p><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p></p><h2>The Mysterious Affair at Styles: Hercule Poirot&#39;s First Case (Hercule Poirot Mysteries)</h2><p>2015 Reprint of 1920 Edition.

In this romantic comedy, Sugar Beth Carey returns, tail between her legs, to her Mississippi hometown, where she has, as a spoiled, rich, wild, and beautiful teen, alienated just about everybody. Now the tables are turned. How the chastened but still impertinent heroine turns her life around, makes amends, and finds love consumes the book's lighthearted pages. The award-winning Kate Fleming (a.k.a. Anna Fields) gives an uneven, albeit always absorbing, reading. She starts out with a dazzling bang before settling into a pleasant but slightly distant interpretation of the narrative. Her impersonation of Sugar Beth's arrogant love interest fails to convince us of his sex appeal. The sex scenes are flat. On the other hand, the dialogue sparkles delightfully.

It saw the first publication of stories by Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, A. E. van Vogt and Theodore Sturgeon, who, with a few others, virtually created modern science fiction, and by Fritz Leiber, one of the fathers of modern fantasy. In celebration of his 50-year career, this hefty volume features 44 of his best shorter works. Included are his first story, "Two Sought Adventure," which introduced the swashbucklers Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, of ancient, imaginary Lankhmar, as well as three other stories about this colorful duo; four horror stories, including "The Girl with the Hungry Eyes," an eerie meditation on the connections between sex, death and advertising; the science-fictional "Sanity," "A Pail of Air" and the cautionary "Coming Attractions"; the hilarious spoof of Mickey Spillane, "The Night He Cried"; and the joyful, chilling "Gonna Roll the Bones," about a confrontation with the Devil over a gambling table, for the highest of stakes. A literate and effective writer, Leiber is one of the two best fantasists to come out of the pulps--the other is Bradbury--but he remains under-appreciated.

Her commissions fetch high prices and appear in city squares, hospital grounds and public gardens and fountains. She teaches at the Chicago Mosaic School, and her summer workshops in the U.K. sell out year after year. </p><p>Foreword<br> This new edition brings a fresh look at some aspects of the art of pebble mosaics: new artists, new developments and new materials. In the last four years I have acquired a role as information gatherer, archivist and facilitator, putting artists, craftsmen and technicians in contact with each other across the world - in addition to responding to pleas for advice. So, there's plenty of news! It's a pleasure to show you some recent pebble mosaics that have been made all over the world, by both professional artists and enthusiastic amateurs.<br> Catching the pebble "bug" can be life-changing: conscious of our mortality we grasp at the idea of permanence. There is a spiritual satisfaction to be gained from the careful placing of natural stones in rhythmic patterns and bonding them together like fossils in a lava flow. There is a basic appeal in the pebble as a found object, formed by the great forces of nature, recalling memories of happy childhood days spent on sunny beaches. We are naturally drawn to the smoothness of rounded stone; it's a small and perfect emblem of the earth we walk on. When we pick up a pebble and marvel at its beauty, we are holding a chunk of our planet; and when we pick up handfuls, and arrange them together in patterns we are reflecting the universe. Children love to do it; so do adults, if they give themselves the time to play. Some take it one step further, to make their collection of stones into something more permanent: designing, making and then leaving for posterity a pebble mosaic.<br> However, even for the long-lived mosaic, times are changing. Today, imported pebbles from the Far East have become widely available and have altered the appearance and color of pebblework and, to some extent, our attitude. I regret the loss of those long days on the beach or the riverbank, searching for pristine and perfect material. Collecting our own pebbles brings a local distinctiveness to the craft, impossible to reproduce with foreign imports. But we have to use what we can get and, at least for the moment, the imports seem to be endless, whereas our own supplies are increasingly protected or unavailable.<br> There have been other changes too. Commercial products such as "pebble tiles" have become widely available. They are cheap and cheerful and presented as a fashionable design solution, less permanent by nature, but more easily and cheaply achieved than the hand-made original genre. While we must recognize the trend, and to some extent adjust to the influence of fashion, I hope that the reader will once more indulge me as I bang the drum for the best and only the best in pebble mosaic. No half-measures.<br> Design is everything! At the end of the day it is the designs with real artistic merit which will be valued and preserved. And good design for pebble mosaic means precise drawing, making use of the special shapes and properties of natural pebbles, and giving due consideration to the context in which the mosaic is to be placed. Within these guidelines, the solutions are endless. I never cease to be amazed at the variety of effects produced with the same materials by different artists and craftsmen.<br> Bear in mind that it is never too late to change the design while it is still on paper. The process of making a mosaic is so laborious and time-consuing the it pays to be absolutely sure that the design is the best that you can do.<br> Make it last! I must enter a plea for permanence. It takes an effort of will and great patience to maintain the highest standards of durability in materials and construction; but a mosaic of real beauty which will also last for hundreds of years is our ultimate aim.<br> So, what you will see in this book is the best of pebble mosaic. The examples have been chosen on the basis that they are either original or inventive, or otherwise interesting for some aspect of their material construction. What we all know as "worthy projects" have not been included. Also, "complete" editions are never truly complete, and I hope to continue to gather information and bring it into the public domain in the future.<br> My courses and workshops in the art of pebble mosaic are documented here. I know that people love to have personal one-on-one teaching, and the experience has also been rewarding for me. But it is my hope that the newly inspired will be brave enough to learn from the step-by-step sequences in this book without recourse to expensive workshop tuition. Many have done so from my previous books.<br> All newcomers to the art are welcome to make use of designs in Section 3 as a starting-point for their work; although (please!) not for profit. Having gained experience and confidence, when you go on to make your own designs, do let me see your creations. I am always interested and forever thankful. </p> <p>- Maggy Howarth</p></p><h2>Choc Shock (EJ12 Book 5)</h2><p>SHADOW is cooking up a new invention which could put SHINE in a real jam.

Giyt soon fixes Tupelo's computers and finds himself elected mayor but thereby makes an enemy of the obstructive and evasive Ex-Earth resident agent Hoak Hagbarth. At first naive and immature, Giyt learns to get along with the various ``eeties,'' who all refer to Tupelo as the Peace Planet. Hagbarth tries to pressure Giyt into grabbing control of the planet's interstellar transporter and, later, to help smuggle in forbidden weapons; when Giyt resists, Hagbarth resorts to dirty tricks.

Their country expanded, shrunk, split and sometimes disappeared, often under circumstances far beyond their control. Despite these often overwhelming pressures, Vietnam has survived as one of Asia&#39;s most striking and complex cultures. As more and more visitors come to this extraordinary country, there has been for some years a need for a major history - a book which allows the outsider to understand the many layers left by earlier emperors, rebels, priests and colonizers. Christopher Goscha&#39;s new work amply fills this role. Drawing on a lifetime of thinking about Indo-China, he has created a narrative which is consistently seen from &#39;inside&#39; Vietnam but never loses sight of the connections to the &#39;outside&#39;. As wave after wave of invaders - whether Chinese, French, Japanese or American - have been ultimately expelled, we see the terrible cost to the Vietnamese themselves. Vietnam&#39;s role in one of the Cold War&#39;s longest conflicts has meant that its past has been endlessly abused for propaganda purposes and it is perhaps only now that the events which created the modern state can be seen from a truly historical perspective. Christopher Goscha draws on the latest research and discoveries in Vietnamese, French and English. His book is a major achievement, describing both the grand narrative of Vietnam&#39;s story but also the byways, curiosities, differences, cultures and peoples that have done so much over the centuries to define the many versions of Vietnam.</p><p>Christopher Goscha is professor of history at the University of Quebec at Montreal.

In <i>A Portrait of Jesus,</i> bestselling writer Joseph Girzone recaptures the truth of Jesus that is presented in the Gospels and gives a compelling vision of the person Jesus' contemporaries must have known. In his most powerful work yet, Girzone seeks to personify Christ in the minds of readers by asking some simple questions: "What did people see in Jesus as he walked down the street? How did he approach others and what would these people take away from meeting him? What do his actions tell us about how we can live our lives today?" It is Girzone's empowering and loving understanding of the heart of Christianity that will make <i>A Portrait of Jesus</i> a groundbreaking classic in the tradition of his bestselling books, <i>Joshua</i> and <i>Never Alone.</i></p><p><p>Joseph F. Girzone retired from the active priesthood in 1981 for health reasons and then embarked on a successful second career as a writer and international speaker. In 1995 he established the Joshua Foundation, an organization dedicated to making Jesus better known throughout the world. His bestselling titles include <i>Joshua</i>&nbsp;and <i>Never Alone</i>. He lives in Albany, New York.</p>FOREWORD<br><br>I loved my work as a priest. Whether in parishes or in schools or in community involvement, I enjoyed working not only with my own people but with people and clergy of other religions. I thoroughly enjoyed the spirit of camaraderie generated among us. We worked well together. Some clergy, sadly, kept themselves aloof and chose not to associate with people of other religions, feeling their religion was the true religion and that it would be sinful to give the appearance of endorsing another religion. I suppose that was where we as Catholics were at not very long ago, and where some of us still are. But for those of us who did break out of that crusty shell, we learned to appreciate one another and see how each of us was loved by God and expressed a facet of Jesus the others had overlooked. We were all concerned about our work, about our people, about the exciting and discouraging happenings in our communities.<br><br>It took a long time, however, for me to realize that there was something missing in our approach to religion, and this made me feel uneasy. We were sensitive to the customs and traditions of each of our churches. We were aware and concerned about community problems. We, as clergy, were conscientious about protecting our people's faith and their allegiance to their church and synagogue, which we should be. But there was something that did not ring true. One day it struck me that while we were all church- or synagogue-oriented, we did not seem to be sensitive to what might be God's concerns. After all, God is our religion. Churches and synagogues are merely the vehicles of God's message. Their teaching of widely divergent messages impressed me as fragmenting the unity of God's mind, and not reflecting an intelligent, caring God to a world reaching out for comfort and healing. I began to realize it didn't make sense that we were wandering in so many different<br>directions when God's mind is one. Catholics were in love with Church and obsessed with Church laws and customs, and insensitive to those who could not maintain the Church's ideals. Protestants were obsessed with the Bible and their conflicting interpretations of Scripture as well as their own customs and taboos, and were equally insensitive to sinners. Jews were obsessed with keeping their people loyal to their bloodlines, and careful not to let them become too close to Christians. Belief in God often seemed secondary, and sensitivity to God's concerns to be almost nowhere in focus. A synagogue member could be an agnostic or an atheist. That was acceptable, but to become a Christian was<br>unthinkable and meant excommunication, and not very long ago, hanging a crepe on the front door of the person's home was not a rarity. It struck me that God could not be happy with that kind of mentality. These obsessions kept us all, while being ceremoniously friendly, at a safe distance from one another, carefully preserving the invisible walls that divided us, and paying only token homage to any real gesture toward unity. I could not help but feel that what God wished was of little concern. Occasionally, something genuine and beautiful would happen, like what occurred between the local Lutheran parish and our own. The pastor and I became good friends. We did services together. We prayed together. We gathered our congregations together for joint liturgies. We even talked our two bishops into agreeing to co-confirm the children in both our parishes. We were fast approaching real unity. And something similar happened with a local synagogue, Orthodox, no less. We were discussing allowing members of our communities to be members of each other's congregations. Another situation occurred between a local Methodist parish and our own, where we used to speak at each other's service on a regular basis and I would cover for the pastor when he was away.<br><br>These situations, however, were the exception. For the most part, we never really took formal steps toward unity. This bothered me deeply because I always felt a need for us all to draw closer to one another. That's what God would want, I thought. We did talk about unity and ecumenism, but rarely were we bold enough to take that giant step toward becoming really one. Unity is a frightening experience when clergy's personal lifestyle and support system is tied to the institution. The hierarchy feel that before unity can become a reality, theologians must agree on a formula, then people would be allowed to become one. It doesn't make sense, because it assumes that just because theologians<br>agree on a formula, the people, like unthinking sheep, will automatically alter their beliefs of a lifetime and accept theologians' formulas. If unity is ever to become a reality, people will have to gather together by charity first, then, as love breaks down the cobweb walls, they will<br>gradually grow to understand Jesus better, and in understanding Him, adopt His vision and understanding, which should be the theological basis for unity.<br><br>This realization deepened when it dawned on me one day that although we were involved in our churches, Jesus' interests were, to a great extent, not an element in our decision-making. For Christian leaders, His interests should be foremost, but Church and theology and the demands of canon law had become the primary focus of so many and had practically replaced a sense of Jesus in making decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bible, on the other hand, had become the religion of the Protestants, as they rejected the teaching authority that originally gave the New Testament<br>Scriptures authenticity. For many Jewish leaders cultural and racial identity&nbsp;&nbsp;had become their religion. God's interests seemed not to be of prime importance, indeed, sometimes they seemed to stand in the way. How else could one explain the horrible religious wars in the former Yugoslavia and Northern Ireland, and South Africa, or the savage meanness in the Holy Land. When I began touring the country, talking about Jesus' life and teaching, I was shocked at the response of people who kept telling me they never heard talks about Jesus' life before. One very holy priest, whom I had known and admired all my life, expressed surprise that I could talk about Jesus for an hour and a half. When I asked him why he was so shocked, he reminded me that we had never been taught about Jesus in the seminary. We were taught&nbsp;&nbsp;theology and scripture and canon law and so many other courses, but no one ever taught any courses about Jesus Himself as a person, and the way He thought and His vision of life.<br><br>I got the same response from Protestants. One seminarian for the priesthood told me she had applied to five prestigious seminaries in her denomination before making her decision. She asked the admissions officers at each one if their seminary taught courses about Jesus. She was shocked when the answer each time was "No, but we teach courses on Christology as electives. They are, however, not required.'' Another Protestant seminarian asked if I would come to his seminary and talk about Jesus. I told him I would be glad to if he arranged with his faculty for an invitation. He told me he would try. I suggested in the meantime that he ask one of the theology professors on staff if he would talk to the seminarians about Jesus. He said he and other students had asked their favorite theology professor. His reply was that he was hired to teach theology, not talk about Jesus.<br><br>A few years ago, Dr. John Killinger, a deeply spiritual Southern Baptist theologian, invited me to speak at the Baptist university where he was teaching. It was a beautiful occasion. After the talk, a number of theology professors and ministers thanked me for speaking to them about Jesus. They said they experienced such healing while I was describing a Jesus who was so new to them. They told me that analyzing texts does not necessarily foster a deeper understanding of Jesus. Too late did they realize that knowing scripture was not the same as knowing Jesus. I was touched by their humility.<br><br>That explained why there has been such overwhelming response to the Joshua books and the follow-up talks about Jesus. People have a hunger for Jesus and for a genuine understanding of what His Good News really is, whether they are Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, or even those who cannot identify with any faith. Jesus' Good News responds to the deepest needs of the human soul, no matter what the person's beliefs or lack of belief, and is intimately tied up with our understanding of who Jesus really is and how He thinks and feels. We can never have a proper understanding of His Good News until we know Him as a person, and have watched the subtle psychological effects He had on people to whom He spoke in the villages and on the hillsides of Palestine. When you see Jesus walking so casually among His very human companions, especially people known to be sinners, and notice how comfortable they are in His presence, you realize for the first time that Jesus did not project an image of self-righteousness or as having a critical spirit. So, sinners had the comforting feeling He accepted them as they were and was patient with them as they slowly refocused their sights on more lofty ideals and began to better their lives. That little piece of information alone is a precious part of the Good News because it shows vividly the attitude Jesus reflected toward people who were looked upon as sinners and outcasts. He did not just tolerate them. He accepted their humanness and allowed them to feel relaxed in His presence. Though they had no sense of His divinity, His attitude toward them was different from that of the officials of the religion, who treated them as&nbsp;&nbsp;sinners and breakers of the law. Jesus did not evaluate them in terms of the law. He accepted them as His Father created them- imperfect, defective, limited in understanding, and frightened. He knew their feelings from his own experience, and could appreciate their fears and feelings asfragile human beings. His warmth and friendlinesstouched them deeply and inspired them to follow His ways. His humble attitude me...</p><h2>I Capture The Castle</h2><p>I Capture the Castle<br>I write this sitting in the kitchen sink" is the memorable first line of this enchanting coming-of-age story, told in the form of Cassandra Mortmain's journal. Cassandra wittily describes life growing up in a crumbling castle, with her father who suffers from crippling writer's block, her glamorous but ineffectual step-mother and her vain but beloved sister Rose. When two visiting Americans arrive, all of their lives are turned upside down, and Cassandra experiences her first love. This is a classic coming-of-age story, beloved of generations of teenage and adult readers, by Dodie Smith, who also wrote The Hundred and One Dalmatians.<br></p><p>Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain wants to become a writer. Trouble is, she's the daughter of a once-famous author with a severe case of writer's block. Her family--beautiful sister Rose, brooding father James, ethereal stepmother Topaz--is barely scraping by in a crumbling English castle they leased when times were good. Now there's very little furniture, hardly any food, and just a few pages of notebook paper left to write on. Bravely making the best of things, Cassandra gets hold of a journal and begins her literary apprenticeship by refusing to face the facts. She writes, "I have just remarked to Rose that our situation is really rather romantic, two girls in this strange and lonely house. She replied that she saw nothing romantic about being shut up in a crumbling ruin surrounded by a sea of mud."<p> Rose longs for suitors and new tea dresses while Cassandra scorns romance: "I know all about the facts of life. And I don't think much of them." But romantic isolation comes to an end both for the family and for Cassandra's heart when the wealthy, adventurous Cotton family takes over the nearby estate. Cassandra is a witty, pensive, observant heroine, just the right voice for chronicling the perilous cusp of adulthood. Some people have compared <i>I Capture the Castle</i> to the novels of Jane Austen, and it's just as well-plotted and witty. But the Mortmains are more bohemian--as much like the Addams Family as like any of Austen's characters. Dodie Smith, author of <i>101 Dalmations</i>, wrote this novel in 1948. And though the story is set in the 1930s, it still feels fresh, and well deserves its reputation as a modern classic. <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>"<i>I Capture the Castle</i> is finally back in print. It should be welcomed with a bouquet of roses and a brass band. Ever since I was handed a tattered copy years ago with the recommendation 'You'll love it,' it has been one of my favorite novels. Cassandra Mortmain is one hell of a narrator, offering sharp wit, piercing insight and touching lyricism. She is a heroine we readers wish we could be, a young woman it is impossible not to adore." --Susan Isaacs<p> "Dreamy and funny...an odd, shimmering timelessness clings to its pages. A thousand and one cheers for its reissue. A+" --<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p><p> "It is an occasion worth celebrating when a sparkling novel, a work of wit, irony and feeling is brought back into print after an absence of many years. So uncork the champagne for <i>I Capture the Castle</i>." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p> "It's as fresh as if it were written this morning and as classic as Jane Austen. I'm very happy to have met it." --Donald Westlake</p><p> "A delicious, compulsively readable novel about young love and its vicissitudes. What fun!" --Erica Jong</p><p> "Much more fun than the reader has any right to expect." --<i>The Weekly Standard</i></p></p><h2>Mouse &amp; Kelley</h2><p>ATTENTION ALL YOU OLD HIPPIES!

He became a frequent visitor to the North Pacific Hall at the American Museum of Natural History where he could lose himself in what he affectionately called "a magic place where the dreams of childhood hold a rendezvous, where century-old tree trunks sing and speak, where undefinable objects watch out for the visitor, with the anxious stare of human faces, where animals of superhuman gentleness join their little paws like hands in prayer." Two and a half million people now visit the Museum each year to share in these enchantments.<p>The American Museum houses the most extensive collection of Northwest Coast Indian art in existence. It includes material from virtually every Indian group that once lived along the west coast of British Columbia and Alaska. In this book, Dr. Aldona Jonaitis traces the history of this magnificent collection, beginning in the late nineteenth century before those coastal peoples had much contact with Europeans, and their customs, languages, and art were still intact. Shortly after the collections was formed, between 1880 and 1910, Indian culture in this region went into a severe decline, to be revived a half century later as another generation of North Americans discovered their heritage.</p><p>The story alternately captivates and distresses. Populations were decimated by disease in the last years of the nineteenth century, art objects left their makers' hands bound for museums all over the world, traditional rituals were outlawed, and governments exerted strong pressures on the Indians to become assimilated. On the other side of the story are the individuals--like Franz Boas, under whose direction much of the Museum collection was assembled, Lt. George Thornton Emmons, who immersed himself in the native cultures, George Hunt, prized Kwakiutl informant for Boas and other researchers, and Charles Edenshaw, master Haida carver and painter--whose colorful lives intersect the Age of Museum Collecting.</p><p>Artifacts in the American Museum come alive through the details Dr. Jonaitis provides of their cultural context, their traditional uses, and their acquisition by collectors. Viewers see spoons and bowls that held food eaten by Boas at a potlatch; feel the spirit power emanating from a shaman's charm removed from its owner's grave by Lieutenant Emmons; sense the sadness behind the display of family crests on a house model carved by Edenshaw.</p><p>Nearly 100 color plates in the book and numerous historical photographs from the Museum's archives recall a bygone era and are a tribute to the stunning artworks of the North Pacific region. Dr. Jonaitis has written the first book devoted solely to the collection of Northwest Coast Indian art in the American Museum of Natural History. As such, the book is both an essential work for scholars and a valuable resource for the general reader.</p></p><p>Enhanced by a text that places each artifact in its cultural context and explains its use, this work is far more than a catalog of the American Museum of Natural History's extensive collection of Northwest Coast Indian art. Jonaitis has compiled a sampling of hundreds of items, using biographies of the early anthropologists that visited Northwest Coast tribes to outline the rites they discovered, and framing her account with old and new photographs of the masks, vessels, and images used in spiritual and physical life. A brief history of the museum is also given. Highly recommended for libraries in the Northwest and for strong Native American collections. David Bryant, Belleville P.L., <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Jonaitis explains how the American Museum of Natural History developed its collection of tribal art from the Northwest Coast. According to PW , this volume is flawed for having only ``a few brief, scattered references to totem poles,'' but its illustrations of shamans' masks, charms, canoes and household items are ``first-rate .

In 1931 her first novel, The Loving Spirit, was published. A biography of her father and three other novels followed, but it was the novel Rebecca that launched her into the literary stratosphere and made her one of the most popular authors of her day. In 1932, du Maurier married Major Frederick Browning, with whom she had three children.Many of du Maurier&#39;s bestselling novels and short stories were adapted into award-winning films, including Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s The Birds and Nicolas Roeg&#39;s Don&#39;t Look Now. In 1969 du Maurier was awarded a DBE. She lived most of her life in Cornwall, the setting for many of her books.<p>One</p> <p>W hen the east wind blows up Helford river the shining waters become troubled and disturbed and the little waves beat angrily upon the sandy shores. The short seas break above the bar at ebb-tide, and the waders fly inland to the mud-flats, their wings skimming the surface, and calling to one another as they go. Only the gulls remain, wheeling and crying above the foam, diving now and again in search of food, their grey feathers glistening with the salt spray. </p> <p>The long rollers of the Channel, travelling from beyond Lizard point, follow hard upon the steep seas at the river mouth, and mingling with the surge and wash of deep sea water comes the brown tide, swollen with the last rains and brackish from the mud, bearing upon its face dead twigs and straws, and strange forgotten things, leaves too early fallen, young birds, and the buds of flowers.</p> <p>The open roadstead is deserted, for an east wind makes uneasy anchorage, and but for the few houses scattered here and there above Helford passage, and the group of bungalows about Port Navas, the river would be the same as it was in a century now forgotten, in a time that has left few memories.</p> <p>In those days the hills and the valleys were alone in splendour, there were no buildings to desecrate the rough fields and cliffs, no chimney pots to peer out of the tall woods. There were a few cottages in Helford hamlet, but they made no impression upon the river life itself, which belonged to the birds &#x2014; curlew and redshank, guillemot and puffin. No yachts rode to the tide then, as they do to-day, and that stretch of placid water where the river divides to Constantine and Gweek was calm and undisturbed.</p> <p>The river was little known, save to a few mariners who had found shelter there when the south-west gales drove them inshore from their course up-channel, and they found the place lonely and austere, a little frightening because of the silence, and when the wind was fair again were glad to weigh anchor and set sail. Helford hamlet was no inducement to a sailor ashore, the few cottage folk dull-witted and uncommunicative, and the fellow who has been away from warmth and women over-long has little desire to wander in the woods or dabble with the waders in the mud at ebb-tide. So the winding river remained unvisited, the woods and the hills untrodden, and all the drowsy beauty of midsummer that gives Helford river a strange enchantment was never seen and never known.</p> <p>To-day there are many voices to blunder in upon the silence. The pleasure steamers come and go, leaving a churning wake, and yachtsmen visit one another, and even the day-tripper, his dull eye surfeited with undigested beauty, ploughs in and out amongst the shallows, a prawning net in hand. Sometimes, in a little puffing car, he jerks his way along the uneven, muddy track that leads sharply to the right out of Helford village, and takes his tea with his fellow-trippers in the stone kitchen of the old farm building that once was Navron House. There is something of grandeur about it even now. Part of the original quadrangle still stands, enclosing the farm-yard of to-day, and the two pillars that once formed the entrance to the house, now over-grown with ivy and encrusted with lichen, serve as props to the modern barn with its corrugated roof.</p> <p>The farm kitchen, where the tripper takes his tea, was part of Navron dining-hall, and the little half-stair, now terminating in a bricked-up wall, was the stair leading to the gallery. The rest of the house must have crumbled away, or been demolished, for the square farm-building, though handsome enough, bears little likeness to the Navron of the old prints, shaped like the letter E, and of the formal garden and the park there is no trace to-day.</p> <p>The tripper eats his split and drinks his tea, smiling upon the landscape, knowing nothing of the woman who stood there once, long ago, in another summer, who caught the gleam of the river amidst the trees, as he does, and who lifted her head to the sky and felt the sun.</p> <p>He hears the homely farm-yard noises, the clanking of pails, the lowing of cattle, the rough voices of the farmer and his son as they call to each other across the yard, but his ears are deaf to the echoes of that other time, when someone whistled softly from the dark belt of trees, his hands cupped to his mouth, and was swiftly answered by the thin, stooping figure crouching beneath the walls of the silent house, while above them the casement opened, and Dona watched and listened, her hands playing a little nameless melody upon the sill, her ringlets falling forward over her face.</p> <p>The river flows on, the trees rustle in the summer wind, and down on the mud flats the oyster-catchers stand at ebb-tide scanning the shallows for food, and the curlews cry, but the men and women of that other time are forgotten, their headstones encrusted with lichen and moss, their names indecipherable.</p> <p>To-day the cattle stamp and churn the earth over the vanished porch of Navron House, where once a man stood as the clock struck midnight, his face smiling in the dim candlelight, his drawn sword in his hand.</p> <p>In spring the farmer's children gather primroses and snowdrops in the banks above the creek, their muddy boots snapping the dead twigs and the fallen leaves of a spent summer, and the creek itself, swollen with the rains of a long winter, looks desolate and grey.</p> <p>The trees still crowd thick and darkly to the water's edge, and the moss is succulent and green upon the little quay where Dona built her fire and looked across the flames and laughed at her lover, but to-day no ship lies at anchor in the pool, with rakish masts pointing to the skies, there is no rattle of chain through the hawse hole, no rich tobacco smell upon the air, no echo of voices coming across the water in a lilting foreign tongue.</p> <p>The solitary yachtsman who leaves his yacht in the open roadstead of Helford, and goes exploring up river in his dinghy on a night in midsummer, when the night-jars call, hesitates when he comes upon the mouth of the creek, for there is something of mystery about it even now, something of enchantment. Being a stranger, the yachtsman looks back over his shoulder to the safe yacht in the roadstead, and to the broad waters of the river, and he pauses, resting on his paddles, aware suddenly of the deep silence of the creek, of its narrow twisting channel, and he feels &#x2014; for no reason known to him &#x2014; that he is an interloper, a trespasser in time. He ventures a little way along the left bank of the creek, the sound of the blades upon the water seeming over-loud and echoing oddly amongst the trees on the farther bank, and as he creeps forward the creek narrows, the trees crowd yet more thickly to the water's edge, and he feels a spell upon him, fascinating, strange, a thing of queer excitement not fully understood.</p> (20090421)</p><h2>Little Bear&#39;s Trousers</h2><p>While looking for his missing trousers, Little Bear discovers that the other toy animals have found many different uses for them</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 1 One morning, Little Bear wakes to find his trousers missing, so he goes from one stuffed-animal friend to another in search of them. Each time, he's one step behind, finding that his clothing has been used and passed along: Sailor tried them as sails for his boat, Rabbit as a hat, with plenty of room for his ears, etc. Finally, Little Bear re trieves his trousers from Bramwell Brown, who has converted them to a double-barreled icing bag to decorate the cake he's baked. All share the cake in celebration of the trousers' return. This is a playful extension of the imaginative game of taking an object and finding various uncustomary uses. It's an idea that works better visually than it does in words, and the pictures here stand out in their near photo-realism and their dimen sionality. Those are real toys on the page, fiber by fiber, but at the same time, they look quite reasonably capable of moving and talking. It's just the visual represen tation of the life that small children can breathe into their toys, and the close-up perspective adds to the sense of realism. The illustrations are the strength of the book; the text repeats information found in them, belaboring the point, and it has its precious moments. It's fun to look at, especially with those pleasantly vibrant colors. Karen Litton, Confederation Centre Public Library, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hissey's textured illustrations, so lifelike that they resemble hand-tinted photographs, are as remarkable here as in her Old Bear. All the toy characters are back, helping Little Bear locate lost trousers, which everyone has used differently: Camel as hump-warmers, Rabbit as a holey ski hat, Dog as a two-bone bone-holder, among others. Little Bear despairs but finds that his trousers are now Bramwell Brown's icing baghe's frosting a cake. The cake is dubbedrather arbitrarily, it seemsTrousers Day Cake, and Little Bear is soothed. That forgiveably weak ending is offset by the snug household scenes the friends inhabit; the rooms aren't scaled down, so there's a perfectly delightful depiction of Rabbit skiing down a slick bannister on tongue depressors. From the nubby terry-cloth towel to the pearl stitches of a knit hat and shiny chrome faucets, Hissey's world makes readers believe that Old Bear could be just around the next corner.

Hardcover with dust jacket, 326 pages, published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap.</p><p></p><h2>Ashenden</h2><p><p> Fact is a poor story-teller as Maugham reminds us. Fact starts a story at random, rambles on inconsequently and tails off , leaving loose ends, without a conclusion. It works up to an interesting situation, has no sense of climax and whittles away its dramatic effects in irrelevance. While some novelists believe this is a proper model for fiction, Maugham believes that fiction should not seek to copy life, but instead choose from life what is curious, telling, and dramatic, but keep to it closely enough not to shock the reader into disbelief. In short, fiction should excite, interest, and absorb the reader.</p> <p> <i>Ashenden: The British Agent</i> is founded on Maugham's experiences in the English Intelligence Department during World War I, but rearranged for the purposes of fiction. This fascinating book contains the most expert stories of espionage ever written. For a period of time after it was first published the book became official required reading for persons entering the secret service.</p> <p> The plot follows the imaginary John Ashenden who during World War I is a spy for British Intelligence. He is sent first to Geneva and later to Russia. Instead of one story from start to finish, the chapters contain individual stories involving many different characters. All of the people whom Ashenden meet during his travels have their own reason for being involved in the spy game, and each are more complex than they first look.</p></p><p><p> <em>W. Somerset </em><em>Maugham </em>(1874-1965) was an English novelist and playwright. Maugham was famous as a dramatist before he was known for his novels and short stories. His clarity of style, the perfection of his form, and the subtlety of his thought, thinly veiled by a worldly cynicism made him an international figure.

She lives in Clear Lake, Iowa.First love is sweet for a fresh-faced country girl in bestselling author Garlock's latest romance, set in 1920s Missouri. Since her mother's death, lovely Julie Jones has cared for her farmer father and five siblings. She dotes on her family, but she also dreams of the day a worthy love will come and whisk her away. When Evan Johnson, the son of the Joneses' despised neighbor, Walter, comes home to take over his father's farm, he proves a pleasant surprise. The handsome young WWI vet has a college education, and is nothing like his drunken, abusive father. Julie worries that he'll never notice a country girl, but Evan falls fast for her and her lively, tight-knit family. The course of true love does sport a few bumps: a neighbor's pretty sister, Birdie, and her daughter come to visit and Birdie sets her cap for Julie's father, Jethro, managing to stir up plenty of trouble. Meanwhile, local lawman Corbin Appleby is stalking a rapist who has been preying on the young women of the county for years, and who hovers frighteningly near the Jones family. A secret Julie has kept for years threatens the lovers' happiness, too, but trust and justice win the day in this heartland romance. Garlock's dark and incongruously graphic rape subplot seems out of place in an otherwise charming story, but her sprightly dialogue and convincing depiction of family farm life rescue the tale.

But while dancing the Cowpoke Polka, Moosha crashes through the floor! She is stuck, right in the only place the tree can go. Will Christmas even come this year?</p><p>Chaconas is an Albert Whitman author.PreS-Gr. 2. This rhyming story of what happens when too many cows come home--not to a barn, but to a real house--is a nifty twist on holiday books. Using pastel chalk, Chapman gives barnyard bovines a homey, humorous look, decking them out in overalls, jumpers, and, for one baby calf, jammies. The story moves from greeting at the door on a winter's night, with chalky mounds of snow and a sky dotted with stars, to cows' chowing down and then joining in a Cowpoke Polka. The crisis comes when Moosha's hooves get stuck in the floor (the very spot where the Christmas tree should stand), and the others--cows, horses, goats, pigs, and even a tractor--work to pull Moosha out. Their failure leads to a new Christmas tradition--decorating the cow. Giddy, goofy fun. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The famously big-footed dancer who made her picture-book debut in <i>Belinda the Ballerina</i> (2002) is prepared to take Paris by storm--except for one catastrophic detail: the airline has mistakenly shipped her pointe shoes to Pago Pago. Belinda pounds the pavement searching for a replacement pair of boat-sized ballet slippers, but as a salesman at the finest specialty store diplomatically informs her, "there is not a shoe in all of Paris that will fit such magnificent feet." Even the cobbler is stymied; there's not a length of pink silk or a form large enough for the job. Persistence pays, though, and Belinda's fans will enjoy her triumph.

This book examines the immensity of Homer&#39;s artistic accomplishments, focusing not only on his masterpieces in various media but also on the suites of works on the same subject that reflect the artist&#39;s essentially modern practices of thinking and working serially and thematically.</p><p>The 19th-century realist Winslow Homer first gained wide renown with his Civil War battlefield illustrations in Harper's Weekly. A year spent in Paris after the war led to a greater acuity of vision, and by the mid-1870s he was one of the leading progenitors of naturalism and the most celebrated American painter of his day. Known for his watercolors, which have all the intensity and ardor of the most accomplished oil paintings, the solid outlines and luminosity of his surfaces show little influence from his contemporaries the Impressionists. His art was unquestionably individual and native. He was a reclusive outdoorsman who captured dozens of scenes highlighting the milieus he loved: seafaring vessels, Adirondack and Canadian hunting grounds, Bahamian beaches, and the rocky coast of Maine, to which he retreated in his last years. This outstanding new book is the catalog of a retrospective of 235 paintings touring East Coast museums?the largest gathering of his work ever. Cikovsky and Kelly (curators of American and British art at the National Gallery of Art) divide his career into eight chronological chapters, each with a straightforward, expository essay securely planting the work in a geographical and biographical context. The format is large but unostentatious, striking the perfect balance between text and illustration. This is easily the fairest, most intelligent, and best survey to date on this popular American master.?Douglas F. Smith, Oakland P.L., Cal.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Winslow Homer (1836^-1910) was in the news as a comprehensive retrospective of his magnificent paintings and watercolors opened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., an exhibition that will live on between the covers of this spectacular volume. Cikovsky and Kelly, curators at the National Gallery, present a contextually rich and vibrant analysis of Homer's life and groundbreaking work. A self-taught artist with an "almost sensuous love of paint," Homer, like so many of his contemporaries, was deeply affected by the Civil War. His early illustrations and paintings demonstrate his "technical strength and assurance; color, modeling, and drawing; truthfulness, and lack of sentimentality," qualities he would elevate to new levels as he moved on to paint candid scenes of everyday life. There is an earthy grace to his dignified, hardworking figures, many of whom gaze contemplatively out into the distance, a gaze not unlike that of the artist himself. The authors track Homer's major themes, all of which are intrinsically connected to place, and discuss the progression from ideology to aesthetics, from shimmering pastoral romance to dark and stormy seas. Homer was a master not only of technique but also of interpreting light, motion, and our complex relationship with nature. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Sting - Memoirs: Escape Artist</h2><p>&#34;Having been a songwriter most of my life, condensing my ideas and emotions into short rhyming couplets and setting them to music, I had never really considered writing a book, but upon arriving at the reflective age of fifty,I found myself drawn, for the first time, to write long passages that were as stimulating and intriguing to me as any songwriting I had ever done. And so &#39;Broken Music&#39; began to take shape. It is a book about the early part of my life, from childhood through adolescence, right up to the eve of my success with the Police. It is a story very few people know. I had no interest in writing a traditional autobiographical recitation of everything that&#39;s ever happened to me. Instead I was drawn to exploring specific moments, certain people and relationships, and particular events which still resonate powerfully for me as I try to understand the child I was, and the man I became.&#34; STING</p><p>Sting is an award-winning singer, songwriter and human rights activist.Music has always been my refuge from sadness. The guitar I inherited from my uncle John now has decent strings, and I&#x2019;m no longer making the &#x201c;broken&#x201d; music that so upset my grandmother; in fact I&#x2019;m making a lot of progress, but the limitations of my first instrument are holding me back. There are things that I simply can&#x2019;t do with this primitive heirloom.<br><br>From the money I earned on the milk rounds I have saved up enough for a new acoustic guitar that I&#x2019;ve had my eye on. It has been hanging from the wall in Braidford&#x2019;s Music Shop for three months now. I go and see it after school every evening, praying that no one has bought it. It is a beautiful steel&#x2014;stringed instrument with a blond finish, an ebony fingerboard, and delicate marquetry inlaid around the sound hole. It costs me sixteen guineas, which is a large amount of money, but I&#x2019;m in love for the very first time.<br><br>I first heard the Beatles in my final year at junior school. I remember being in the changing rooms of the swimming baths. Mr. Law had just supervised one of our chaotic and impossibly noisy trips to the baths&#x2014;by &#x201c;supervised&#x201d; I mean that no one had actually been drowned. We were drying ourselves off and, as was our custom, flicking towels at each other&#x2019;s genitals. It was at this point that we heard the first bars of &#x201c;Love Me Do&#x201d; from a transistor radio in the corner. The effect was immediate. There was something in the sparseness of the sound that immediately put a stop to the horseplay. John&#x2019;s lonely harmonica and Paul&#x2019;s bass played &#x201c;two to the bar,&#x201d; and then the vocal harmony moved in modal fifths up to minor thirds and back again to a solo voice on the refrain. Not that I could articulate any of this at the time, but I recognized something significant, even revolutionary, in the spare economy of the sound, and the interesting thing is, so did everyone else.<br><br>By the time &#x201c;She Loves You&#x201d; reached number one in the charts I was already at the grammar school, but it wasn&#x2019;t the confident primitivism of the &#x201c;yeah yeah yeah&#x201d; chorus that excited me so much as the G major chord with an added sixth that colored it at the end of the coda. Again, I couldn&#x2019;t articulate this then, but I knew as the G major chord with an added sixth that colored it at the end of the coda. An old dance band clich�, but when the Beatles used it there seemed to be a subtle irony at work. Again, I couldn&#x2019;t articulate this then, but I knew instinctively that it was pointing to a level of sophistication that I hadn&#x2019;t been aware of in pop music until then. The Beatles would succeed in manipulating as many musical forms into their songs, whether classical, folk, rock and roll, the blues, Indian raga, or vaudeville, in a dizzying and seamless pastiche of ideas and cultural references. It was music without frontiers and the ubiquitous soundtrack for a generation that thought it could change the world.<br><br>Jim Berryman, in his otherwise excellent biography, <i>A Sting in the Tale</i>, claims that I was outside the City Hall when the Fab Four played there in 1963, and that I managed to grab a lock of McCartney&#x2019;s hair. This is of course fantasy, and would have been out of keeping with the budding intellectual pretensions that I was nurturing at the time. But it is impossible to stress too much the influence that the Beatles had on my early life, and the fact that they came from a similar background to my own was fundamental to the vague plans of escape and glory that I was hatching in my imagination. Lennon and McCartney were both grammar school boys from humble roots in Liverpool, a town not dissimilar from Newcastle. From their initial chart successes they went on to conquer the world with songs that they wrote themselves. This gave an entire generation of musicians the confidence and permission to at least attempt the same feat.<br><br>I pore over Beatles albums with the same obsessive and forensic scrutiny that I&#x2019;d applied to Rodgers and Hammerstein, only now I have a guitar. I have an instrument that can reproduce the practical magic of the chord structures and the network of riffs that their songs are built on. And what songs, one after the other, album after album. I learn to play them all, confident that if I persevere, what I can&#x2019;t play immediately will yield its secret eventually. I will reapply the needle of the record player again and again to the bars of music that seem beyond my analysis, like a safecracker picking a lock, until the prize is mine. No school subject ever occupies as much of my time or energy. I&#x2019;m not claiming that any kind of prescience about the future is at work here, but there is something in the driven and compulsive nature of this obsession that is unusual, something in the unconscious saying, This is how you escape. This is how you escape.<br><br>It is 1966 and England, having won the World Cup against Germany that summer, is at last enjoying the fruits of the postwar boom and is considered to be, in the quaint argot of the time, &#x201c;swinging.&#x201d; In Newcastle, however, the hedonism of social change and cultural revolution is limited to a small enclave surrounding the university. King&#x2019;s College gives the pubs and clubs and bookshops an air of musty intellectualism and bohemian sophistication. Wittgenstein, of all people, is supposed to have spent some time in the city during the war&#x2014;I can just see him trying to explain the more difficult passages of Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus to the coves in the Haymarket snug in a blue haze of Woodbines and brown ale.<br><br>The Club A Go-Go is above some shops in Percy Street, behind the Haymarket. It was originally a jazz club catering to the sophisticated tastes that developed in and around the university. The Go-Go is where the Animals had their residency before they hit the big time, and living proof that the Beatles miracle could be repeated, even in Newcastle. When I am fifteen years old, the first live band I ever see is there: the Graham Bond Organisation. It is a fortunate introduction. Graham Bond is a big round-faced man with long greasy hair and a mandarin mustache. He plays Hammond organ and alto sax and sings in a gruff and passionate baritone. His band contains figures who will soon become legends: Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, who will become more famous as members of Cream, on bass and drums respectively, and Dick Heckstall-Smith on tenor. The music is harsh and uncompromising and I&#x2019;m not sure if I like it, but I have a strong sense that what is being played has a weight and a seriousness that will later be characterized and then caricatured as &#x201c;heavy.&#x201d; Graham Bond would later become obsessed with the occult and end his own life under a train in London&#x2019;s Underground.<br><br>I go to see John Mayall&#x2019;s Bluesbreakers, again at the Go-Go, although I don&#x2019;t remember which of their subsequently legendary guitarists was on duty that night. It certainly wasn&#x2019;t Clapton, though it may have been Peter Green. But it wasn&#x2019;t until December of that year that I really had my mind blown.<br><br>I would watch Top of the Pops with a religious devotion at 7:30 every Thursday evening. I loved this show with a passion. Almost forty years later I can still see a picture of the DJ, Jimmy Savile, standing in front of a large chart of the top twenty, circa 1966, and am able to sing a line from every entry. Such familiarity with the music of the time could not, however, have prepared me for the whirlwind, the tidal wave, the earthquake, the force of nature that was Jimi Hendrix.<br><br>The Jimi Hendrix Experience appeared on Top of the Pops in December of 1966 and changed everything. Hendrix had transformed &#x201c;Hey Joe,&#x201d; an old folk song, and propelled it by the elegant ferocity of his guitar playing into a sassy, bluesy vehicle of awesome power. His vocal was as sulky and offhand as it was passionate and openly sexual, and as the three-piece band stormed through the three-minute song, I imagined everyone in whole country in front of their tellys sitting bolt upright in their chairs.<br><br>Wow! What the fuck was that?<br><br>It seemed only days later that he would be booked to appear at the Go-Go. The excitement in the town is palpable. I am technically too young to gain admission to a nightclub, but because of my height I can easily pass for eighteen. I have brought a change of clothes in my schoolbag, a pair of Levi&#x2019;s and a white Ben Sherman shirt with a button-down collar. These are the &#x201c;coolest&#x201d; clothes I have, and look fine under my school overcoat. I change out of my uniform in the toilets at the Central Station, trying not to breathe. The lavatory is foul with the pungent stench of urine and sadness. I dress with mesmeric slowness, not wanting to drop any of my clothes on the filthy floor, beneath a faded Ministry of Health poster warning of the dangers of VD. Some hope! I still haven&#x2019;t come close to having sex. There are no girls at school, and most of my evenings are taken up traveling home on trains and buses. When I do get home, I usually have a punitive amount of work to do, and when on those rare opportunities I do meet girls I am painfully shy and haven&#x2019;t a clue what to say. But the other reason is music; I already have my passion. I stow my bag in the lockers at the station and set off at a brisk pace for Percy Street, breathing in the crisp air of the evening in grateful gulps and anticipating something extraordinary.<br><br>There is a long queue stretching around the corner. I tuck myself into the end of the line and wait. I imagine I&#x2019;m one of the youngest people there, although my height allows me some anonymity in the crowd. They are mainly boys, dressed much the same as me, although a few dandified &#x201c;exotics&#x201d; have managed to purchase Afghan coats and are sporting droopy Zapata mustaches and spiffy desert boots. The girls all have the same style, hair parted severely in the middle and falling in lank sheets to t...</p><h2>Spirits Out of Time: True Family Ghost Stories and Weird Paranormal Experiences</h2><p><p><em>I have always been fascinated by secrets...</em></p> <p>So begins Annie Wilder's collection of true family ghost stories, gathered from old letters and family genealogy books or told around the dinner table.

The collection of blue-and-white tents on the airport grounds sprawled across the tarmac. The tents&#x2019; entrance flaps bore stenciling that read UNHCR. Big, Russian-built helicopters pounded in and out of the airfield. Each helo displayed the roundel of the Afghan Air Force&#x2014;a circle enclosing a triangle of green, red, and black. Gold saw a few American Black Hawks, too.</p><p>A familiar odor filled her nostrils: trash fires and sewage, along with the smell of dust. Even if she&#x2019;d been blind, she would have recognized the location. The scents filled her with both dread and familiarity, almost a homecoming. She&#x2019;d left part of herself here, and that part now belonged to Afghanistan.</p><p>Gold had talked to Parson by Skype when her plane made a fuel stop in Kuwait; as an individual augmentee, she&#x2019;d made some of her own arrangements to get to her duty station. He&#x2019;d told her he&#x2019;d meet her at the MASF&#x2014;the Mobile Aeromedical Staging Facility. No sign of him yet, though. Just doctors and nurses moving among patients lying on green cots set up in brown tents.</p><p>An Afghan helicopter landed. Though its rotors quit turning, some sort of power unit inside continued to operate. The chopper emitted a jetlike howl, and exhaust gases shimmered from a port.</p><p>Crew members opened clamshell doors in the back and began unloading patients. The injured lay on stretchers, and crewmen lifted them out of the aircraft and lined them up on the tarmac. All the fliers looked like Afghans, except one who was taller than the rest. From his short hair and clean-shaven face, Gold knew he was probably an American. He carried a faded green helmet bag covered with patches. When she noticed the slight limp and the way he pulled at his flight suit sleeve to check his watch, she knew it was Parson.</p><p>Gold found a set of foam earplugs in a pocket of her ACUs, and she twisted them between her fingers and inserted them into her ears before approaching the helicopter. As Gold strode toward the aircraft, Parson looked up and smiled at her. She waved, and when she reached him he extended his right hand, and she took it in both of hers. She wanted to embrace him, but not in front of the other troops, and certainly not in front of the Afghans.</p><p>He looked tired. The skin below his eyes sagged, and grime gathered in the creases of his neck. He wore his usual desert tan flight suit, only this one had blue oak leaves on the shoulders. The command patch over his right chest pocket read us CENTAF. He had a few flecks of gray in his hair now, but he looked pretty good for someone who&#x2019;d once been blown up. Since their flight through hell last year, they had kept in touch, and she&#x2019;d last seen him about two months ago. That was before his deployment, and he&#x2019;d still worn a major&#x2019;s brown leaves then.</p><p>&#x201c;Damn, it&#x2019;s good to see you,&#x201d; Parson shouted over the noise.</p><p>&#x201c;Likewise,&#x201d; Gold said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m sorry about the circumstances.&#x201d; It seemed in Afghanistan, there was always reason to be sorry about the circumstances.</p><p>Parson nodded, then leaned inside the helicopter&#x2019;s crew door. &#x201c;Hey, Rashid,&#x201d; he yelled, &#x201c;kill the APU.&#x201d;</p><p>Indistinct words came from the cockpit, and Parson repeated: &#x201c;APU. Turn it off.&#x201d; Then he slashed his finger across his throat. The screaming whine subsided. Parson turned back toward Gold and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not always that easy to communicate. That&#x2019;s why I need you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where did you just fly from?&#x201d; Gold asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Balkh. It&#x2019;s pretty rough up there.&#x201d;</p><p>Gold looked at the patients. Dust covered some of them, as if they&#x2019;d just been pulled from rubble. A girl with a bloody bandage around the stump of her arm stared up at Gold. Her hair shone with an auburn tint, and her eyes were blue. The sight nearly brought Gold to tears. She wished she could take the child in her arms and carry her to a better time and place for a little girl. Gold figured she was probably a Tajik, but those eyes and hair could suggest Russian, British, or even Macedonian. A lot of armies had entered Afghanistan and then retreated, but they&#x2019;d left their chromosomes. Two medics picked up the child&#x2019;s stretcher and carried her into the MASF.</p><p>Another patient, a young man, moaned and kept rocking from side to side. He wore a bloody T-shirt and black trousers. He had a tennis shoe on his right foot, but his left foot was bare, and a broken bone protruded from the skin. The man clutched at his abdomen as he cried out.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with him?&#x201d; Gold asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Internal injuries, maybe. I think a ceiling fell on him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll help you get him inside.&#x201d;</p><p>Gold took one end of the stretcher by its wooden handles, and they brought the man into the medical tent. As they put him down, Gold asked in Pashto, &#x201c;Does your stomach hurt?&#x201d;</p><p>In addition to the broken foot, she could see bruises and scrapes all over the man&#x2019;s face and arms. The blood on his shirt appeared to come from those injuries. His midsection seemed to pain him more than anything else, but the cause was not apparent. The man did not respond to Gold&#x2019;s question.</p><p>&#x201c;Where does it hurt, my friend?&#x201d; Gold asked. <i>&#x201c;Pohaigay?&#x201d;</i> Do you understand?</p><p>&#x201c;I cannot say to you,&#x201d; the man said.</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever is wrong,&#x201d; Gold said, &#x201c;let us help you. <i>Meh daarigah</i>.&#x201d; Do not be frightened.</p><p>Inside the MASF, flight nurses and medics tended rows of patients lying on cots. Murmurs of conversations babbled through the tent in several languages. Amid the usual English, Pashto, and Dari, Gold heard snatches of French, German, and Russian. Some of the medical workers wore uniforms, and others wore civilian clothes. Several countries had contributed help from their military services, and Gold assumed the civilians came from the UN and from NGOs such as Doctors Without Borders. Gold retained a special fondness for people who worked to ease pain; she had spent so much time fighting those who inflicted it. But right now she just wanted to get this guy to talk.</p><p>&#x201c;We have doctors for you,&#x201d; she said in Pashto. The man still did not respond.</p><p>A medic kneeled by the man&#x2019;s stretcher. The medic wore MultiCam fatigues with flight crew wings and airborne jump wings, along with badges for combat diver and free-fall parachutist. A sleeve patch from the 83rd Expeditionary Rescue Squadron. The five stripes of a technical sergeant. Close-cropped black hair. Rolled-up sleeves bulged around muscles that looked hard as Kevlar. His name tag read REYES.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you pararescue?&#x201d; Parson asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; Reyes said. He did not look up at Parson and Gold. Instead, he pulled medical shears from his pocket and began cutting away the patient&#x2019;s shirt.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s been holding his stomach, but he won&#x2019;t tell us what&#x2019;s wrong,&#x201d; Gold said.</p><p>Reyes touched the man&#x2019;s abdomen. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not hard or discolored like you&#x2019;d have with a bad internal injury,&#x201d; he said. Reyes&#x2019;s accent suggested someone whose first language was Spanish. Puerto Rican, perhaps.</p><p>The patient continued moaning, and sweat beaded on his forehead. Reyes took a multitool from a sheath on his belt and opened the blade. &#x201c;These guys don&#x2019;t like to be stripped,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but I gotta examine him.&#x201d; The pararescueman cut the man&#x2019;s rope belt and checked his groin area. Gold saw blood there, and she turned away. She knew the patient wouldn&#x2019;t want an American woman to see him like this.</p><p>&#x201c;Poor guy,&#x201d; Parson said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a bad place to get hit by debris.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll need surgery,&#x201d; Reyes said, &#x201c;but I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;ll lose anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s with his stomach?&#x201d; Parson asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cover him and let me talk to him,&#x201d; Gold said.</p><p>Reyes left and came back with a towel that he draped over the patient. The man still looked sick and uncomfortable. Gold kneeled beside him and said in Pashto, &#x201c;These people can treat you, but you must talk to us. Your injury is not a punishment from God; it is merely an accident. You have no reason to feel shame.&#x201d;</p><p>The man looked at her with moist eyes and said, &#x201c;I&#x2014;I cannot urinate.&#x201d;</p><p>Gold translated what the man said. &#x201c;I sure hope his bladder hasn&#x2019;t ruptured,&#x201d; Reyes said. He touched the man&#x2019;s abdomen again. &#x201c;Yeah, the bladder area&#x2019;s distended.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What can you do?&#x201d; Gold asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d;</p><p>Reyes returned with a plastic container, a small needle and syringe, a larger needle, and an IV cannula with a length of tubing.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that for?&#x201d; Gold asked.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s going to get a suprapubic needle cystotomy. Talk to him. See if you can get him not to look at what I&#x2019;m doing.&#x201d; Reyes pulled back the towel, then ripped open a Betadine pad and rubbed it on the man&#x2019;s skin. With the small needle, he injected something just under the skin.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you giving him?&#x201d; Gold asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Local anesthetic,&#x201d; Reyes said. &#x201c;Lidocaine.&#x201d;</p><p>Gold tapped the man on the shoulder and said in Pashto, &#x201c;Where are you from?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Balkh,&#x201d; the man said.</p><p>Reyes raised the large needle and uncoiled the tubing. He left one end of the tubing in the plastic container.</p><p>&#x201c;I have never seen Balkh,&#x201d; Gold said. The man glanced down at his waist, and Gold asked, &#x201c;Is it a pretty place?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>Reyes inserted the needle straight into the patient&#x2019;s bladder. The man cried out and clutched at the towel. Even if he didn&#x2019;t feel the pain, Gold imagined, he knew something cold and metal had just pushed inside him. Yellow fluid began to flow into the container. Reyes taped the IV cannula into place. The man closed his eyes and sighed.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Tashakor</i>,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;He says thank you,&#x201d; Gold said.</p><p>&#x201c;Glad I got that right the first time,&#x201d; Reyes said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d hate to stick him like that twice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Tashakor</i>,&#x201d; the man repeated.</p><p>&#x201c;Will he be okay?&#x201d; Parson asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, but I think it would have ruptured before the end of the day if you guys hadn&#x2019;t brought him in.&#x201d;</p><p>Gold looked down the rows of patients. Some had suffered amputations. Some cried out in agony. Some looked near death. Only the man Reyes had just treated showed any sign of relief. A drop of mercy in an ocean of pain.</p><p>Just then, the lightbulb fixtures suspended overhead began to sway. Gold felt strange rolling sensation through the soles of her boots, as if for a moment the earth had turned to jelly. Patients cried to Allah.</p><p>&#x201c;Aftershock,&#x201d; Parson said.</p><p>Parson reached into his helmet bag and took out his satphone. He dialed a duty officer with Joint Relief Task Force at Bagram Air Base. When the officer picked up, Parson said, &#x201c;Felt like we just got hit again up here. What kind of damage reports do you have?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A few more buildings down in Mazar. Other than that, we don&#x2019;t know much. A lot of the outlying villages didn&#x2019;t have phone service to begin with, and those that did have lost their cell towers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in Mazar with an Afghan flight crew,&#x201d; Parson said. &#x201c;What do you need us to do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The ops commander wants all available helicopter crews to survey the villages. Find out how much worse it is now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There are some PJs up here with us,&#x201d; Parson said. &#x201c;Can I get some of those guys on board the Mi-17s?&#x201d;</p><p>American pararescuemen didn&#x2019;t normally fly with Afghan crews, but in the aftermath of the quake, a lot of regs had been waived. Parson hoped he could bend one more rule.</p><p>&#x201c;Stand by,&#x201d; the duty officer said. When he came back on the line, he said, &#x201c;Commander says okay. We&#x2019;ll cut the flight orders and fax them up there.&#x201d;</p><p>With more people probably hurt, headquarters wanted him to wait for paperwork? Parson started to swear into the phone, but then he caught himself. He looked at Gold, decided to stay on his best behavior.</p><p>&#x201c;Fine, fax the flight orders when you can,&#x201d; Parson said. &#x201c;But can we go ahead and launch on the commander&#x2019;s verbal approval?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stand by, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Parson waited, fuming. It seemed the most common phrase in the Air Force was stand by. When the duty officer came back, he spoke a less common phrase&#x2014;one Parson liked better: &#x201c;That&#x2019;s approved.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Roger that,&#x201d; Parson said. So somebody showed some sense down there at Bagram. He cradled the phone against his shoulder while he pulled a Tactical Pilotage Chart from his helmet bag. He unfolded the TPC across an empty cot. &#x201c;All right, then,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Which villages?&#x201d; Parson jotted in the margins as he listened, circled a dot on the chart.</p><p>After the phone call, Parson found Rashid and his crew. &#x201c;They want us to check Ghandaki,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We have some American PJs we can take with us, and I got an interpreter you&#x2019;re gonna like.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;PJs?&#x201d; Rashid asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Pararescue jumpers,&#x201d; Parson explained. &#x201c;Badass medics.&#x201d;</p><p>Parson reminded himself to stop throwing acronyms at Rashid. The guy was smart, but he had a hard enough time with standard English, let alone Air Force jargon. Rashid probably didn&#x2019;t know what badass meant, either.</p><p>Reyes and another PJ, Sergeant Burlingame, brought a wheeled cage filled with equipment out to the Mi-17. Parson helped them lift it into the chopper. When he raised his end of the cage, it felt like it weighed at least a couple hundred pounds. Inside it, he saw a crash ax, a sledgehammer, a power saw, and some other items he did not recognize.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell is this?&#x201d; Parson asked.</p><p>&#x201c;A REDS kit,&#x201d; Reyes said. &#x201c;Rapid extrication tools. We use it for pulling you flyboys out of wreckage. But it&#x2019;ll help get people out of collapsed buildings, too.&#x201d;</p><p>Rashid looked on with a puzzled expression. Gold spoke in rapid-fire Pashto, and Rashid said in English, &#x201c;That is very . . .&#x201d; Then he and Gold had another exchange in Pashto.</p><p>&#x201c;Impressive,&#x201d; Gold said finally.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Rashid said. &#x201c;That is very impressive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you ever need a PJ,&#x201d; Parson said, &#x201c;it means you&#x2019;re in a world of hurt.&#x201d;</p><p>Rashid nodded, but he didn&#x2019;t look like he really understood until Gold translated. Then he said, &#x201c;I fear many Afghans are in hurt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Parson said. &#x201c;We might as well go find out.&#x201d; He pulled on his flak vest, clicked its snaps into place. Then he put his arms through the sleeves of his Nomex jacket and zipped it over the vest. Now he wore protection from both fire and shrapnel.</p><p>Rashid and his copilot and flight engineer strapped into the cockpit and donned their white helmets. Parson, Gold, and the two PJs buckled into troop seats in the back.</p><p>The Afghans spoke just a few words on interphone, and the two Klimov engines spun up. Parson did not understand the terse conversation, but it didn&#x2019;t sound like enough talk for a proper engine start checklist. He&#x2019;d have to work on their checklist discipline: Someday these guys might go on to fly more advanced aircraft, and you didn&#x2019;t just jump into an Apache and fire it up from memory like starting a Chevy. But for now, the fine points would have to wait.</p><p>As the rotors increased speed, Parson felt the vibration in his molars. He&#x2019;d never get used to that. He&#x2019;d spent his career in machines that rode the air. This one beat it into submission.</p><p>The Mi-17 lifted off, lowered its nose, gathered speed, climbed. Through the door on the left side, Parson could see the refugee camp and then the city of Mazar as Rashid made a turn to the southeast. The helo&#x2019;s shadow flew across the ground ahead of the aircraft like its own disembodied spir...</p></p><h2>Kitty Corner: Otis</h2><p>From the bestselling author of THE PUPPY PLACE.<br><br>Someone has left Otis, an adorable tabby, all alone at the local community center.

I'd learned that whatever I said would be misquoted, so I simply kept quiet. Once, I made the mistake of telling the truth to a female reporter. She'd looked so young and so in need herself that for a moment I let my guard down. I said, "He needs me." That's all. Just those three words.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that a second of unguarded honesty could cause so much turmoil? The girl -- she had certainly not attained the maturity of womanhood -- parlayed my small sentence into international turmoil.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I was right in thinking she herself was needy. Oh, yes, very needy. She needed a story, so she fabricated one. Never mind that she had nothing on which to base her fable.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I must say that she was good at research. She couldn't have slept during the two weeks between my remark and the publication of her story. She consulted psychiatrists, self-help gurus, and clergy. She interviewed hordes of rampant feminists. Every famous woman who had ever hinted that she hated men was interviewed and quoted.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the end Jimmie and I were portrayed as one sick couple. He was the domineering tyrant in public, but a whimpering child at home. And I was shown to be a cross between steel and an ever-flowing breast.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When the article came out and caused a sensation, I wanted to hide from the world. I wanted to retreat to the most remote of Jimmie's twelve houses and never leave. But Jimmie was afraid of nothing -- which was the true secret of his success -- and he met the questions, the derisive laughter, and worse, the pseudo-therapists who felt it was our "duty" to expose every private thought and feeling to the world, head-on.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jimmie just put his arm around me, smiled into the cameras, and laughed in answer to all of their questions. Whatever they asked, he had a joke for a reply.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Is it true, Mr. Manville, that your wife is the power behind the throne?" The reporter asking this was smiling at me in a nasty way. Jimmie was six foot two and built like the bull some people said he was, and I am five foot two and round. I've never looked like the power behind anyone.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"She makes all the decisions. I'm just her front man," Jimmie said, his smile showing his famous teeth. But those of us who knew him saw the coldness in his eyes. Jimmie didn't like any disparagement of what he considered his. "I couldn't have done it without her," he said in that teasing way of his. Few people knew him well enough to know whether or not he was joking.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Three weeks later, by chance, I saw the cameraman who'd been with the reporter that day. He was a favorite of mine because he didn't delight in sending his editor the pictures of me that showed off my double chin at its most unflattering angle. "What happened to your friend who was so interested in my marriage?" I asked, trying to sound friendly. "Fired," the photographer said. "I beg your pardon?" He was pushing new batteries into his camera and didn't look up. "Fired," he said again, then looked up, not at me, but at Jimmie.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Wisely, the photographer said no more. And just as wisely, I didn't ask any more questions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jimmie and I had an unwritten, unspoken law: I didn't interfere in whatever Jimmie was doing.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Like a Mafia wife," my sister said to me about a year after Jimmie and I were married.</p><p>ard</p><p></p><p>"Jimmie doesn't murder people," I replied in anger.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That night I told Jimmie of the exchange with my sister, and for a moment his eyes glittered in a way that, back then, I hadn't yet learned to be wary of.</p><p></p><p></p><p> A month later, my sister's husband received a fabulous job offer: double his salary; free housing; free cars. A full-time nanny for their daughter, three maids, and a country club membership were included. It was a job they couldn't refuse. It was in Morocco.</p><p></p><p></p><p>After Jimmie's plane crashed and left me a widow at thirty-two, all the media around the world wrote of only one thing: that Jimmie had willed me "nothing." None of his billions -- two or twenty of them, I never could remember how many -- none of it was left to me.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Are we broke or rich today?" I'd often ask him, because his net worth fluctuated from day to day, depending on what Jimmie was trying at the moment.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Today we're broke," he'd say, and he would laugh in the same way as when he'd tell me he'd made so many millions that day.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The money never mattered to Jimmie. No one understood that. To him, it was just a by-product of the game. "It's like all those peels you throw away after you've made jam," he'd say. "Only in this case the world values the peel and not the jam." "Poor world," I said, then Jimmie laughed hard and carried me upstairs, where he made sweet love to me.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It's my opinion that Jimmie knew he wasn't going to live to be an old man. "I've got to do what I can as fast as I can. You with me, Frecks?" he'd ask.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Always," I'd answer, and I meant it. "Always."</p><p></p><p></p><p>But I didn't follow him to the grave. I was left behind, just as Jimmie said I would be.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I'll take care of you, Frecks," he said more than once. When he talked of such things, he always called me by the name he'd given me the first time we met: Frecks for the freckles across my nose.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When he said, "I'll take care of you," I didn't give the words much thought. Jimmie had always "taken care" of me. Whatever I wanted, he gave me long before I knew I wanted it. Jimmie said, "I know you better than you know yourself."</p><p></p><p></p><p>And he did. But then, to be fair, I never had time to get to know much about myself. Following Jimmie all over the world didn't leave a person much time to sit and contemplate.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jimmie knew me, and he did take care of me. Not in the way the world thought was right, but in the way he knew I <i>needed.</i> He didn't leave me a rich widow with half the world's bachelors clamoring to profess love for me. No, he left the money and all twelve of the expensive houses to the only two people in the world he truly hated: his older sister and brother.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To me, Jimmie left a run-down, overgrown farm in the backwoods of Virginia, a place I didn't even know he owned, and a note. It said:</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><i>Find out the truth about what happened, will you, Frecks? Do it for me. And remember that I love you. Wherever you are, whatever you do, remember that I love you.</i><p><i></i></p><p></p><p><i>J.</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>When I saw the farmhouse, I burst into tears. What had enabled me to survive the past six weeks was the image of that farmhouse. I'd imagined something charming, made of logs, with a stone chimney at one end. I'd imagined a deep porch with hand-hewn rocking chairs on it, and a lawn in front, with pink roses spilling petals in the breeze.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I'd envisioned acres of gently rolling land covered with fruit trees and raspberry bushes -- all of them pruned and healthy and dripping ripe fruit.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But what I saw was 1960s hideous. It was a two-story house covered in some sort of green siding -- the kind that never changes over the years. Storms, sun, snow, time, none of it had any effect on that kind of siding. It had been a pale, sickly green when it was installed, and now, many years later, it was the same color.</p><p></p><p></p><p>There were vines growing up one side of the house, but not the kind of vines that make a place look quaint and cozy. These were vines that looked as though they were going to engulf the house, eat it raw, digest it, then regurgitate it in the same ghastly green.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"It can be fixed," Phillip said softly from beside me.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the weeks since Jimmie's death, "hell" could not begin to describe what I had been through.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It was Phillip who woke me in the middle of the night when Jimmie's plane went down. I must say that I was shocked to see him. As Jimmie's wife, I was sac...</p></p><h2>The Chaperon Bride</h2><p>The Chaperon Bride by Nicola Cornick released on Jan 23, 2004 is available now for purchase.</p><p>International bestselling author Nicola Cornick writes historical romance for HQN Books and time slip romance for MIRA UK.

This book is unique among books about nonprofit strategic planning! Many books are all about what information should be in a strategic plan document. This book is about that information, too -- but also about much more! This book is also about how to successfully facilitate the critically important planning process to produce the information in the document -- the planning process is at least as important as the document itself. FUNDERS often require strategic plans from nonprofits seeking funding. Yet, far too many plans sit collecting dust on shelves because the plans were not useful to the nonprofits or the funders. GUARANTEE that your plans will be useful by using this book! Step-by-step guidelines are presented in the order in which the facilitator and nonprofit planners need them. The book provides several different approaches to planning and helps planners select which approach best suits the nature and needs of their nonprofit. RESULTS from using this book, include to: 1) understand the unique nature and needs of nonprofits when conducting strategic planning; 2) ensure the nonprofit is really ready for strategic planning; 3) explain the planning process so that all planners understand and take strong ownership in the process; 4) customize a planning process that is highly relevant, realistic and flexible; 5) ensure the organization is always working on the most important strategic challenges, now and into the future; 6) facilitate strategic planning that suits the diverse natures of planners and also produces relevant plans for them, whether planners prefer a linear/rational or organic/holistic approach to planning; and 7) successfully meet each of the unique challenges that can occur when facilitating planning for the typical nonprofit. (SPECIFICATIONS: Revised December 2007, 284 pages, paperback. Includes numerous, easy-to-use, hardcopy worksheets that can be downloaded and shared with planners, too.)</p><p></p><h2>The Sharp End</h2><p>With two syndicates dominating the planet of Cantilucca, Major Matthew Coke, the head of the Frisian Defense Force, watches as his mercenary force is used to evil ends by Cantilucca&#39;s leaders. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>The gangs ruled Cantilucca.

Cronley Jr. sat in the back of an olive-drab 1942 Chevrolet staff car in his &#x201c;pinks and greens,&#x201d; which is how officers referred to the &#x201c;Class A&#x201d; semi-dress uniform, puffing on a long black cigar, despite a sign on the back of the front seat that read both no smoking! and rauchen verboten!</p><p>Jim Cronley was a six-foot-tall, blond-haired and blue-eyed Texan. The crossed sabers on his lapels identified him as a cavalryman, and his shoulder insignia&#x2014;a three-inch yellow circle outlined in black, with a C in the center pierced by a red lightning bolt&#x2014;identified him as a member of the U.S. Constabulary, which policed the American Zone of Occupied Germany.</p><p>Three and a half hours before, the telephone on his desk in the Compound, which housed the S�d-Deutsche Industrielle Entwicklungsorganisation<i> </i>(South German Industrial Development Organization) in Pullach, a small village about twenty miles from Munich, had flashed a red button, which had caused him to say &#x201c;Shit!&#x201d; as he reached for it.</p><p>His office was in a small, neat building identified by a sign on its small, now snow-covered lawn as the Office of the OMGUS Liaison Officer. OMGUS was the acronym for Office of Military Government, U.S.</p><p>It was, de facto, the headquarters of DCI-Europe, the Directorate of Central Intelligence, which had been formed several months before to replace the Office of Strategic Services by President Harry S Truman and answered only to him.</p><p>The OMGUS sign was an obfuscation, a smoke screen, so to speak, to conceal the truth. So was the Constabulary shoulder �insignia on Jim Cronley&#x2019;s tunic. He was not assigned to the Constabulary. He was listed on the War Department&#x2019;s &#x201c;Detached Officer Roster,&#x201d; which is classified Secret, as being assigned to the Directorate of Central Intelligence.</p><p>He was, in fact, chief, DCI-Europe.</p><p>So was the South German Industrial Development Organization an obfuscation to conceal what had once been Abwehr Ost&#x2014;Intelligence East&#x2014;of the Wehrmacht. Generalmajor Reinhard Gehlen had made a deal with Allen Dulles, then the OSS station chief in Switzerland, not only to surrender to the Americans but to bring with him all his assets, which included agents inside the Kremlin, and to place him and them at the service of the Americans. In exchange, Dulles agreed to protect Gehlen&#x2019;s officers and enlisted men, and their families, from the Russians.</p><p>&#x201c;Cronley,&#x201d; Cronley had said into the handset of the secure �telephone.</p><p>&#x201c;ASA Fulda, sir. Hold for Major Wallace.&#x201d;</p><p>The Army Security Agency was charged with making sure the Army&#x2019;s communications network was not compromised, and, in addition to other services, providing secure encrypted telephone, Teletype, and radio communications.</p><p>&#x201c;Major Wallace, we have Captain Cronley on a secure line.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re invited to Colonel Bob Mattingly&#x2019;s &#x2018;Farewell to USFET&#x2019; party.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I must regretfully decline the kind invitation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It will be held at Schlosshotel Kronberg.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As I have a previous social engagement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So put on your pinks and greens and get in your airplane within the next thirty minutes. A car will be waiting for you at Eschborn.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And wear your DSM.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was told I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to wear it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is a special occasion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t gonna wear the damned thing, which is sort of moot, since I ain&#x2019;t going to fly up there to play nice with Mattingly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When you get an order, Captain Cronley, the correct response is &#x2018;Yes, sir.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>After a ten-second pause, Cronley said, &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>More obfuscation was in play here.</p><p>In order to make DCI-Europe seem less important than it was, to have it sort of fade into the background, it was decided that it be commanded, as far as anyone outside of DCI was concerned, by a junior officer. Such an officer was available in the person of Jim Cronley, who had just been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and promoted from second lieutenant to captain at the verbal order of the President of the United States. The Citation stated that he had demonstrated <i>at the risk of his own life not only valor above and beyond the call of duty but a wisdom far beyond that to be expected of an officer of his age and rank while engaged in a classified operation of great importance</i>.</p><p>DCI-Europe was important, and not only because it was �involved in surreptitiously keeping former members of Abwehr Ost, and their families, many of them Nazis, out of the hands of the Russians by surreptitiously flying them to Argentina. This �activity, should it become public knowledge, would have seen �Truman&#x2014;who had authorized Allen Dulles to make the deal with Gehlen&#x2014;very possibly impeached, even if Eisenhower, who had brought the deal to Truman, agreed to fall on his sword to save the commander in chief.</p><p>Under these conditions, it was obviously necessary to have some experienced intelligence officer looking over Cronley&#x2019;s shoulder to &#x201c;advise&#x201d; him and, should it become necessary, to take �DCI-Europe over. Such an officer was available in the person of Major Harold Wallace, who had been commander of OSS-�Forward until its dissolution, and was now assigned to USFET Counterintelligence.</p><p>And there was more obfuscation here, too. In order to keep &#x201c;Army G-2 off my back,&#x201d; as Wallace, a full colonel, had phrased it, he had taken the eagle off his epaulets and replaced it with the golden leaf of a major and allowed the Army to think Colonel Robert Mattingly was actually commanding OSS-Forward.</p><p>Major Wallace was given command of the XXVIIth CIC �Detachment in Munich, from which position he was able to look over the activities of the XXIIIrd CIC Detachment, commanded by Captain James D. Cronley, which had been established to provide Cronley with a credible reason for being in Munich, in the hope that people would not connect him with DCI-Europe at the Compound.</p><p>Originally, Cronley was not told of Wallace&#x2019;s role, but he soon figured it out. They worked out an amicable relationship, largely because Cronley accepted that Wallace could give him orders.</p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>[TWO]</b></p><p>As Cronley entered the lobby of the Schlosshotel, a bellman snatched his canvas Valv-Pak from his hand and led him to the desk.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to need a room,&#x201d; he said to the clerk.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very sorry, Captain, the Schlosshotel Kronberg is a senior officers&#x2019; hotel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought this was a low-class dump the moment I walked in,&#x201d; Cronley said, his automatic mouth having gone into action.</p><p>Another clerk rushed over.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Sind Sie Hauptmann Cronley, Herr Hauptmann?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Ja.&#x201d;</i></p><p>The clerk switched to English.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve put you in 110, Captain.

Cronley did so, out of the lobby and down a corridor, where the lieutenant opened half of a double door, gestured for Cronley to precede him, and then bellowed, &#x201c;Admiral, Captain Cronley.&#x201d;</p><p>Cronley looked into the room. There were six people sitting around a table on which were three bottles of whiskey, an ice bucket, and a soda siphon. He recognized two of them. Harold Wallace and Oscar Schultz. He saw that Wallace had the silver eagles of his actual rank on the epaulets. Oscar was in a business&nbsp;suit.</p><p><i>And that has to be Admiral Souers. All that gold on his sleeves.</i></p><p><i>What the hell is going on here?</i></p><p>&#x201c;Well, come on in,&#x201d; Schultz called. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t just stand there.&#x201d;</p><p>Cronley walked up to the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know the protocol.

In the box it came in.&#x201d;</p><p>Wallace put his hand out, palm up.</p><p>Cronley took an oblong blue-leather-covered box from his tunic pocket and laid it in Wallace&#x2019;s hand. Wallace opened it and withdrew the Distinguished Service Medal.</p><p>&#x201c;I see you also brought your &#x2018;I Was There&#x2019; ribbons,&#x201d; Wallace said. &#x201c;Good.&#x201d;</p><p>He referred to the small colored ribbons Cronley and millions of others had been awarded, the World War II Victory Medal testifying that they had been in the service when the war had been won; the European Theater of Operations Medal, awarded to �everyone serving in Europe; and the Army of Occupation Medal&#x2013;Germany, awarded to everyone serving in Occupied Germany.</p><p>Cronley&#x2019;s mouth went on automatic. &#x201c;Modesty prevents me from wearing them,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>That earned him a dirty look from Wallace, but he saw Admiral Souers and the others smiling.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me about the Legion of Merit, Cronley,&#x201d; the admiral said.</p><p>Cronley knew the Legion of Merit ranked immediately below the Distinguished Service Medal but his mouth was still on automatic: &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that what they award majors and up for ninety days&#x2019; service in the Army of Occupation for not coming down with �either the clap or syphilis?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Watch your goddamn mouth!&#x201d; Wallace snapped.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll tell President Truman you said that,&#x201d; Admiral Souers said.</p><p>&#x201c;Sir, I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Cronley said. &#x201c;My automatic mouth ran away with me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As it often does.

By direction of the President, the Legion of Merit is awarded to Captain James D. Cronley Junior, Cavalry, Army of the United States. Citation: Captain Cronley was called upon to assume command of the Directorate of Central Intelligence&#x2013;Europe when circumstances did not permit the assignment of an appropriately senior officer to that position. During his tenure as chief, DCI-Europe, Captain Cronley demonstrated characteristics of leadership and professionalism far above those to be expected of someone of his rank and length of service. He also proved his willingness to risk his life above and beyond the call of duty on many occasions when carrying out his duties. His outstanding performance and his valor reflected great credit upon the Directorate of Central Intelligence and the Office of the President of the United States. By Order of Harry S Truman, President of the United States and commander in chief of its Armed Forces.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p><i>What that sounds like is that I am no longer chief, DCI-Europe.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Wipe that confused look off your face and try to look serious while I pin this thing on, Cronley,&#x201d; the admiral said. &#x201c;The �pictures are for President Truman.&#x201d;</p><p>Cronley did his best to comply with the order.</p><p>&#x201c;You got enough, Jack?&#x201d; the admiral asked of the man with the Leica.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. Now I suggest someone pour Cronley a drink before he starts asking questions.&#x201d;</p><p>He walked back to the table, sat down, and motioned for Cronley to take the seat beside him.</p><p>&#x201c;Scotch or bourbon, Captain?&#x201d; the admiral&#x2019;s aide asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Scotch, please.&#x201d;</p><p>The drinks were poured.</p><p>The admiral raised his glass.</p><p>&#x201c;To Captain James D. Cronley, DSM, LM,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Everyone raised their glasses. There was a chorus of &#x201c;Hear! Hear!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The chair will now entertain any questions the captain may have,&#x201d; the admiral said.</p><p>&#x201c;Why wasn&#x2019;t I just relieved? And you know I don&#x2019;t deserve the Legion of Merit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean, son, that you did come down with the clap?&#x201d;</p><p>There was laughter.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, serious answers. You ever hear, son, what Eisenhower replied when someone asked him the secret of his success at �Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ike said, &#x2018;I think it&#x2019;s my knack of getting people who, with reason, hate each other to work together.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201c;Ike came to see me. Somehow, he had learned of us going to G-2 at the War Department with those movies you had made with those two Peenem�nde Nazis. The Blackmail Movie, as Jack put it. <i>Lay off DCI or we&#x2019;ll show these movies to the President.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Ike said, &#x2018;Sid, you&#x2014;we&#x2014;won this one, but the war between your man Cronley and General Seidel has to be called off. General Seidel is not going to quit until he buries Cronley. His ego is involved. And in trying to bury your young captain, he&#x2019;s likely to do something that will cause Operation Ost to blow up in our face, which means the President&#x2019;s face, and our primary obligation is to protect him.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201c;I asked Ike what he had in mind, and surprising me not at all, it made a hell of a lot of sense, so I took it to the President, and he agreed, a little reluctantly, to it. Harry said it looked like you were getting the shitty end of the stick, and he didn&#x2019;t like that. Hence, the Legion of Merit, and his own contribution to Operation Peace.</p><p>&#x201c;What Ike is going to do is transfer General Seidel to the Pentagon, where Ike will tell him to lay off DCI. He will also tell him that you&#x2019;ve been relieved as chief, DCI-Europe, and that an officer of suitable rank and experience has been appointed to that position, Harold Wallace. When a new man is sent to be USFET G-2, that&#x2019;s who he&#x2019;ll deal with.</p></b></p><h2>Oman Off-road</h2><p>The ultimate accessory for any 4WD, the Oman Off-Road Explorer helps drivers to discover Oman's 'outback.'

The other fighters were already trooping into the long hall where they were all fed, whooping as they filed along the trestle tables and grabbed for the wine jugs. </p> <p>&#x201c;Quiet, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; The Thracian jogged his elbow. &#x201c;So where you from? I came over from Greece last year&#x2014; &#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201d; said Arius in his flat grating Latin. </p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; </p> <p>Brushing past the Thracian into the hall, he ignored the trestle tables and the platters of bread and meat. He leaned over and grabbed the first wine jug he saw, then headed off down another small ill- lit hallway. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind him,&#x201d; he heard another fighter growl to the Thracian. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a sour bastard.&#x201d; </p> <p>Arius&#x2019;s room in the gladiator barracks was a tiny bare cell. Stone walls, a chair, a straw pallet, a guttering tallow candle. He sank down on the floor, setting his back against the wall and draining half the jug in a few methodical gulps. The cheap grapes left a sour taste in his mouth. No matter. Roman wine was quick, and all he wanted was quick. </p> <p>&#x201c;Knock knock!&#x201d; a voice trilled at the door. &#x201c;I hope you aren&#x2019;t asleep yet, dear boy.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;Piss off, Gallus.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;Tut, tut. Is that any way to treat your <i>lanista</i>? Not to mention your friend?&#x201d; Gallus swept in, vast and pink- fleshed in his immaculate toga, gold gleaming on every finger, magnolia oil shining on every curled hair, a little silk- decked slave boy at his side. Owner of the Mars Street gladiator school. </p> <p>Arius spat out a toneless obscenity. Gallus laughed. &#x201c;Now, now, none of that. I came to congratulate you. Such a splendid debut. When you sent the head flying clean off that African . . . so dramatic! I was a little surprised, of course. Such dedication, such savagery, from one who swore not an hour before that he wouldn&#x2019;t fight at all . . .&#x201d; </p> <p>Arius took another deep swallow of wine. </p> <p>&#x201c;Well, how nice it is to be right. The first time I saw you, I knew you had potential. A little old for the arena, of course&#x2014; how old are you, anyway? Twenty- five, thirty? No youngster, but you&#x2019;ve certainly got <i>something</i>.&#x201d; Gallus waved his silver pomander languidly. Arius looked at him. </p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get another fight in the next games, of course. Something a little bigger and grander, if I can persuade Quintus Pollio. A solo bout, perhaps. And this time&#x201d;&#x2014; a glass- sharp glance&#x2014; &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t have to worry that you&#x2019;ll deliver, will I.&#x201d; </p> <p>Arius aligned the wine jug against the wall. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a <i>rudius</i>?&#x201d; The words surprised him, and he kept his eyes on the jug. &#x201c;A <i>rudius</i>?&#x201d; Gallus blinked. &#x201c;Dear boy, wherever did you hear about that?&#x201d; </p> <p>Arius shrugged. They had all been waiting in the dark under the Colosseum before their bout, nervous and excited, fingering their weapons. <i>Here&#x2019;s to a </i> rudius <i>for all of us</i>, one of the others had muttered. </p> <p>A man who had died five minutes later under a trident before Arius could ask him what it meant. </p> <p>&#x201c;A <i>rudius </i> is a myth,&#x201d; Gallus said airily. &#x201c;A wooden sword given from the Emperor to a gladiator, signaling his freedom. I suppose it&#x2019;s happened once or twice for the stars of the arena, but that hardly includes you, does it? One bout, and not even a solo bout&#x2014; you&#x2019;ve got a long way to go before you can call yourself a success, much less a star.&#x201d; </p> <p>Arius shrugged. </p> <p>&#x201c;Such a dear boy.&#x201d; Gallus reached out and stroked Arius&#x2019;s arm. His plump fingers pinched hard, and his black peppercorn eyes locked onto Arius&#x2019;s with bright curiosity. </p> <p>Arius reached out, picked up the tallow candle beside him, and calmly poured a stream of hot wax onto the soft manicured hand. Gallus snatched his burned fingers away. &#x201c;We really will have to do something about your manners,&#x201d; he sighed. &#x201c;Good night, then. Dear boy.&#x201d; </p> <p>As soon as the door thudded shut, Arius picked up the wine jug and drank off every drop. Letting the jug fall, he dropped his head back against the stones. The room wasn&#x2019;t spinning anymore. Not enough wine. He closed his eyes. </p> <p>He hadn&#x2019;t meant to fight. He&#x2019;d meant what he&#x2019;d told Gallus, standing in the dim passage underneath the arena, hearing the roars of the crowd and the screams of the wounded men and the whimpers of the dying animals. But the sword had been placed in his hand, and he&#x2019;d gone out with the others in the brisk group battle that served to whet the crowd&#x2019;s appetite for the solo bouts, and he&#x2019;d seen the African he&#x2019;d been paired to fight . . . and the black demon had uncoiled from its self- devouring circles in his brain and roared joyously down the straight and simple path of murder. </p> <p>Then suddenly he had been standing blinking in the sunlight with another man&#x2019;s blood on his face and cheers pouring down on his head like a swarm of bees. Just thinking about those cheers brought an icy sweat. The arena. That hellish arena. It spoiled his luck every time. Even slaughtering its guards had failed to get him killed. After that savage beating seven months ago, he had awakened in bed. Not a soft bed; Gallus didn&#x2019;t waste luxuries on half- dead slaves. Dragging himself painfully into the light, he heard for the first time Gallus&#x2019;s voice: high, modulated, reeking of the slums. </p> <p>&#x201c;Can you hear me, boy? Nod if you understand. Good. What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; </p> <p>Hoarsely he croaked it out. </p> <p>Gallus tittered. &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s absurd. A Briton, aren&#x2019;t you? You barbarians always have impossible names. Well, it won&#x2019;t do. We&#x2019;ll call you Arius. A bit like Aries, the god of war. Quite catchy, yes, we can do something with that. </p> <p>&#x201c;Now. I&#x2019;ve bought you, and paid a pretty price, too, for a half- dead troublemaker. Yes, I know exactly why you were sentenced to the arena. You were part of a chain gang making repairs on the Colosseum, until you strangled a guard with his own whip. Very foolish, dear boy. Whatever were you thinking?&#x201d; Gallus snapped for his little slave boy with the tray of sweetmeats. &#x201c;Well, then&#x201d;&#x2014; eating busily&#x2014; &#x201c;you can tell me for starts how you ended up working a chain gang in the Colosseum.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;Salt mines,&#x201d; Arius forced out through swollen lips. &#x201c;In Trinovantia. Then Gaul.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;Dear me. And how long have you been working in those sinkholes?&#x201d; </p> <p>Arius shrugged. Twelve years? He wasn&#x2019;t sure. </p> <p>&#x201c;A long time, clearly. That explains the strength of the arms and chest.&#x201d; A plump finger traced over Arius&#x2019;s shoulders. &#x201c;Hauling rocks of salt up and down mountains for years; oh yes, it builds fine men.&#x201d; A last lingering stroke. &#x201c;One doesn&#x2019;t learn to use a sword in the mines, however. Where did you learn that, eh?&#x201d; </p> <p>Arius turned his face toward the wall. </p> <p>&#x201c;Well, no matter. Time to listen. You&#x2019;ll do your fighting for me from now on, when and where I say. I am a <i>lanista</i>. Know what that is? No? I thought your Latin was a little rough. Everything about you is a little rough, isn&#x2019;t it? A <i>lanista </i> is a trainer, dear boy, of gladiators. You&#x2019;re going to be a gladiator. It&#x2019;s a good life as they go&#x2014; women, riches, fame. You&#x2019;ll take the oath now, and begin training as soon as those bones patch up. Repeat after me: <i>&#x2018;I undertake to be burnt by fire, to be bound in chains, to be beaten by rods, and to die by the sword.&#x2019;</i> That&#x2019;s the gladiator&#x2019;s oath, dear boy.&#x201d;</p> <p>Arius told him hoarsely what he could do with his oath, and collapsed back into blackness. </p> <p>It had been days before he could get out of bed, weeks before his bones were whole, and nearly five months before his training in the gladiators&#x2019; courtyard was complete. His fellow fighters were petty criminals and bewildered slaves scummed off the bottom of the market: a cheap cut- rate bunch. Arius slid indifferently into the school&#x2019;s routine: just one more thug with Gallus&#x2019;s crude crossed- swords tattoo on his arm.

Awaiting execution in 1535 for refusing to betray his faith, Thomas More opens the door on his own interior life by creating a fictional dialogue. It takes place in 16th century Hungary between a young man, Vincent, and his dying but wise old uncle, Anthony. Vincent is paralyzed by fear of an impending Turkish invasion which could force him to betray his faith or die a martyr. As he pours out his fears, Anthony responds as only the calm and clear-headed More could do: on the comfort of God in difficulties, the benefits of suffering, atonement for evil acts, faintheartedness and the temptations to suicide, and scrupulosity. Anthony thus summarized his purpose: &#34;I will supply you ahead of time with a store of comfort, of spiritual strengthening and consolation, that you can have ready at hand, that you can resort to and lay up in your heart as an antidote against the poison of despairing dread...&#34; Put into modern English and edited by Mary Gottschalk.

As a collection of separate and diverse texts, it can be rather daunting to study. After all, it is the only one of the standard works that does not tell its own story. Making Sense of the Doctrine and Covenants addresses this challenge in a creative new way. Rather than giving a verse-by-verse commentary, author Steven C. Harper takes readers on a guided tour through the revelations. Drawing on the earliest manuscripts of those revelations, he provides historically grounded insights into why each revelation was given, what it means, and why it matters. Chapters on every section of the Doctrine and Covenants begin by delving into the historical record to recreate the question or problem each revelation was given to resolve and end by showing readers the outcomes for individuals and the Church. Families and scholars alike will relish the depth and accessibility of Making Sense of the Doctrine and Covenants.

Young readers must listen and watch carefully in order to track one story's clues that later pop up in another story. For example, Albert and his horse June take a shortcut over the railroad tracks on their way to sell melons at the market. Because they get there so early they are able to go home sooner than planned. Three chapters later, Albert and June's efficiency leads to another character's disappointment... and even a run-in with the law. Then there's poor Professor Tweet, who runs afowl of a hot-air balloon ride. But a few chapters later we discover that Professor Tweet's misfortune has lead to another man's most excellent fortune! Macaulay's characters are thoroughly engaging, such as the horse June, who wears curlers in her mane and likes to kick back in front of the TV. Many know Macaulay as the master of pen-and-ink detail, but here he proves himself as a versatile color artist, offering a richly blended palette and unusual visual perspectives. A funny, child-friendly shortcut into the study of cause and effect.

Then -- just one more thing and the murderer realizes that his murder plot has unraveled. Columbo, played by the marvelous Peter Falk, appeared as a made-for-television movie in 1968, then the long-running series in 1971 and kept coming back over the decades. One of the finest detective series ever to appear on television, Columbo was created by William Link and his late collaborator Richard Levinson. With The Columbo Collection, Link has written 12 brilliant new stories in which murderers try to get away with murder but come up against the rumpled but unflappable Lieutenant Columbo.</p><p>WILLIAM LINK was born in Philadelphia and grew up in a neighboring suburb. At four years old, he began drawing stories before he had learned to write. Then pencil in hand he drew his own comic books with his own super heroes. Much later, incongruously, he received his degree from the Wharton School of Business where, for his senior thesis, he submitted three original TV scripts, which he later sold. And then along came Hollywood. With his childhood best friend and collaborator, Richard Levinson, they became legends in their own time. Link and Levinson created fourteen on-the-air TV series including Columbo, Murder She Wrote, Mannix, McCloud, Ellery Queen, The Bold Ones, as well as the Broadway musical, Merlin, motion pictures, stage plays and books. After Levinson&#39;s untimely death in 1987, Link co-created two more television series, Probe and The Cosby Mysteries, wrote plays, short stories, and was president of the Mystery Writers of America. As Link said, a business education was a safety net if he and Levinson failed in a writing career. They never did and millions of television viewers have been enriched by their success.Columbo is, of course, the fictional Los Angeles police detective created 50 years ago by Link and his writing partner, the late Richard Levinson, and famously played on television by Peter Falk. Here, Link offers a dozen original short stories about the character. All the ingredients are here: the crime, the murderer, Columbo&#x2019;s step-by-step assembling of the evidence. The solutions to the cases, as fans will expect, often hinge on one crucial piece of evidence or on gleaning the truth from seemingly insignificant observations. The author incorporates many of Columbo&#x2019;s familiar traits (the raincoat, the cigar, the catchphrases), but these are not pastiches. The book&#x2019;s only real flaw&#x2014;and this may only be a flaw to rabid fans of the TV show&#x2014;is that the stories feel rushed; there&#x2019;s not enough of the signature Columbo meandering, befuddling his suspects with his seemingly slow-witted questioning. These are good stories, and it&#x2019;s great to see Columbo again, but they leave us feeling as if we&#x2019;ve had a snack when we wanted a full-course meal. --David Pitt</p><h2>The Christian Camp Counselor</h2><p>Each summer, thousands of God's servants gather at Christian camps across the country to take up the challenge of becoming counselors to tens of thousands of young campers.

He retires and immediately becomes a "hot dog man" in his own van, parked on a popular street corner. Stan is very happy, and his business is doing well until he is stranded in a snow storm, along with a school bus. The children and the bus driver climb into the hot dog van and enjoy themselves while waiting for the snow plow to rescue them.

On land, terrestrial forms were beginning to make their mark, leaving behind traces such as burrows and track ways and other fossil evidence of the important transition to life on land. The plates in this book capture the incredibly detailed impressions and casts of ancient life, contrasting them with forms, such as the horseshoe crab and the chambered nautilus, that persist today virtually unchanged. </p><p> The shells and hard exoskeletons of invertebrates make them excellent candidates for fossilization, and the amateur fossil collectors are more likely to uncover an invertebrate fossil than any other kind. The fossilized remains of invertebrates dominate university collections and museum holdings worldwide and their study continues to yield important insights into the nature of evolutionary change and the impact of climate change on biodiversity, as great explosions of diversity were succeeded by mass extinctions. Paul D. Taylor and David N. Lewis, both of the Natural History Museum, London, have written a comprehensive and accessible resource, one that provides undergraduates and amateur fossil enthusiasts with a means to understand and interpret this rich fossil record. </p></p><p><b>Paul D.

For students of biology and earth history, it provides an overview of major groups of organisms and their fossil...The book will amply reward the attention given it by the interested layman or interested student. (Donald R. Franceschetti <i>Magill Book Reviews</i>)<br><br>When people think of fossils, they usually think of dinosaur fossils. But the majority of fossils that have been discovered belong to invertebrates, those members of the animal kingdom lacking a backbone. Taylor and Lewis, both of the Natural History Museum in London, take readers back in time millions of years ago, when seas were filled with ammonites, corals, sponges, mollusks, trilobites, and crinoids. Fossils reveal the diversity of life that existed in the past and show what is still present--e.g., horseshoe crabs and the chambered nautilus. The authors provide a comprehensive compendium of information regarding every aspect relating to invertebrate fossils: history, general descriptions, and specifics related to all types of shells and fossils discovered. Numerous plates augment the text and provide visual reference points for readers. This book is an invaluable resource.

The threat of war was as regular as the harvest, alliances made in winter were broken by spring, and there were places where women bore another child by a different invading father every other year. In the great and glorious city of Rome, we had grown soft living under God&#x2019;s protection, but such was the instability of the times that even the holiest of fathers made unholy alliances, and a pope with Medici blood in his veins was always more prone to politics than to prayer.<br><br> In the last few days before the horror struck, Rome still couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to believe that her destruction was nigh. Rumors crept like bad smells through the streets. The stonemasons shoring up the city walls told of a mighty army of Spaniards, their savagery honed on the barbarians of the New World, swelled with cohorts of German Lutherans fueled on the juices of the nuns they had raped on their journey south. Yet when the Roman defense led by the nobleman Renzo de Ceri marched through the town touting for volunteers for the barricades, these same bloodthirsty giants became half-dead men marching on their knees, their assholes close to the ground to dispel all the rotting food and bad wine they had guzzled on the way. In this version, the enemy was so pathetic that,\ even were the soldiers to find the strength to lift their guns, they had no artillery to help them, and with enough stalwart Romans on the battlements, we could drown them in our piss and mockery as they tried to scale their way upward. The joys of war always talk better than they play; still, the prospect of a battle won by urine and bravura was enticing enough to attract a few adventurers with nothing to lose, including our stable boy, who left the next afternoon.<br><br> Two days later, the army arrived at the gates and my lady sent me to get him back.<br><br> On the evening streets, our louche, loud city had closed up like a clam. Those with enough money had already bought their own private armies, leaving the rest to make do with locked doors and badly boarded windows. While my gait is small and bandied, I have always had a homing pigeon&#x2019;s sense of direction, and for all its twists and turns, Rome had long been mapped inside my head. My lady entertained a client once, a merchant captain who mistook my deformity for a sign of God&#x2019;s special grace and who promised me a fortune if I could find him a way to the Indies across the open sea. But I was born with a recurring nightmare of a great bird picking me up in its claws and dropping me into an empty ocean, and for that, and other reasons, I have always been afraid of water.<br><br> As the walls came into sight, I could see neither lookouts nor sentries. Until now we had never had need of such things, our rambling fortifications being more for the delight of antiquarians than for generals. I clambered up by way of one of the side towers, my thighs thrumming from the deep tread of the steps, and stood for a moment catching my breath. Along the stone corridor of the battlement, two figures were slouched down against the wall. Above me, above them, I could make out a low wave of moaning, like the murmur of a congregation at litany in church. In that moment my need to know became greater than my terror of finding out, and I hauled myself up over uneven and broken stones as best I could until I had a glimpse above the top.<br><br> Below me, as far as the eye could see, a great plain of darkness stretched out, spiked by hundreds of flickering candles. The moaning rolled like a slow wind through the night, the sound of an army joined in prayer or talking to itself in its sleep. Until then I think even I had colluded in the myth of our invincibility. Now I knew how the Trojans must have felt as they looked down from their walls and saw the Greeks camped before them, the promise of revenge glinting off their polished shields in the moonlight. Fear spiked my gut as I scrambled back down onto the battlement, and in a fury I went to kick the sleeping sentries awake. Close to, their hoods became cowls, and I made out two young monks, barely old enough to tie their own tassels, their faces pasty and drawn. I drew myself to my full height and squared up to the first, pushing my face into his. He opened his eyes and yelled, thinking that the enemy had sent a fatheaded, smiling devil out of Hell for him early. His panic roused his companion. I put my fingers to my lips and grinned again. This time they both squealed. I&#x2019;ve had my fair share of pleasure from scaring clerics, but at that moment I wished that they had more courage to resist me. A hungry Lutheran would have had them split on his bayonet before they might say Dominus vobiscum. They crossed themselves frantically and, when I questioned them, waved me on toward the gate at San Spirito, where, they said, the defense was stronger. The only strategy I have perfected in life is one to keep my belly full, but even I knew that San Spirito was where the city was at its most vulnerable, with Cardinal Armellini&#x2019;s vineyards reaching to the battlements and a farmhouse built up and into the very stones of the wall itself.<br><br> Our army, such as it was when I found it, was huddled in clumps around the building. A couple of makeshift sentries tried to stop me, but I told them I was there to join the fight, and they laughed so hard they let me through, one of them aiding me along with a kick that missed my rear by a mile. In the camp, half the men were stupid with terror, the other half stupid with drink. I never did find the stable boy, but what I saw instead convinced me that a single breach here and Rome would open up as easily as a wife&#x2019;s legs to her handsome neighbor.<br><br> Back home, I found my mistress awake in her bedroom, and I told her all I had seen. She listened carefully, as she always did. We talked for a while, and then, as the night folded around us, we fell silent, our minds slipping away from our present life, filled with the warmth of wealth and security, toward the horrors of a future that we could barely imagine.<br><br> By the time the attack came, at first light, we were already at work. I had roused the servants before dawn, and my lady had instructed them to lay the great table in the gold room, giving orders to the cook to slaughter the fattest of the pigs and start preparing a banquet the likes of which were usually reserved for cardinals or bankers. While there were mutterings of dissent, such was her authority&#x2014;or possibly their desperation&#x2014;that any plan seemed comforting at the moment, even one that appeared to make no sense.<br><br> The house had already been stripped of its more ostentatious wealth: the great agate vases, the silver plates, the majolica dishes, the gilded crystal Murano drinking glasses, and the best linens had all been stowed away three or four days before, wrapped first inside the embroidered silk hangings, then the heavy Flemish tapestries, and packed into two chests. The smaller one was so ornate with gilt and wood marquetry that it had to be covered again with burlap to save it from the damp. It had taken the cook, the stable boy, and both of the twins to drag the chests into the yard, where a great hole had been dug under the flagstones close to the servants&#x2019; latrines. When they were buried and covered with a blanket of fresh feces (fear is an excellent loosener of the bowels), we let out the five pigs, bought at a greatly inflated price a few days earlier, and they rolled and kicked their way around, grunting their delight as only pigs can do in shit.<br><br> With all trace of the valuables gone, my lady had taken her great necklace&#x2014;the one she had worn to the party at the Strozzi house, where the rooms had been lit by skeletons with candles in their ribs and the wine, many swore afterward, had been as rich and thick as blood&#x2014;and to every servant she had given two fat pearls. The remaining ones she told them were theirs for the dividing if the chests were found unopened when the worst was over. Loyalty is a commodity that grows more expensive when times get bloody, and as an employer Fiammetta Bianchini was as much loved as she was feared, and in this way she cleverly pitted each man as much against himself as against her. As to where she had hidden the rest of her jewelry, well, that she did not reveal.<br><br> What remained after this was done was a modest house of modest wealth with a smattering of ornaments, two lutes, a pious Madonna in the bedroom, and a wood panel of fleshy nymphs in the salon, decoration sufficient to the fact of her dubious profession but without the stench of excess many of our neighbors&#x2019; palazzi emitted. Indeed, a few hours later, as a great cry went up and the church bells began to chime, each one coming fast on the other, telling us that our defenses had been penetrated, the only aroma from our house was that of slow-roasting pig, growing succulent in its own juices.<br><br> Those who lived to tell the tale spoke with a kind of awe of that first breach of the walls; of how, as the fighting got fiercer with the day, a fog had crept up from the marshes behind the enemy lines, thick and gloomy as broth, enveloping the massing attackers below so that our defense force couldn&#x2019;t fire down on them accurately until, like an army of ghosts roaring out of the mist, they were already upon us. After that, whatever courage we might have found...</p><h2>Single Firing: The Pros and Cons</h2><p>Wherever the skills of the potter are taught today, it is likely that the ubiquitous bisc will make its appearance. Twice firing is common practice in almost every field of ceramics, despite the fact that it is historically a relative newcomer. In this book, Fran Tristram explores the older method of single firing, both through its history and through its practice. The reasons for its demise are revealed and explained, the myths surrounding it examined, and practical problems resolved. Although it is true that, like any other technique, single firing will not suit everybody, this book, drawing as it does on the long experience of many well-known single firers (e.g. Lucie Rie, Clive Bowen, Josie Walter), should give confidence to those who are willing to try.</p><p></p><h2>The Velveteen Rabbit Mini Kit: Plush Toy and Illustrated Book (RP Minis)</h2><p><p><i>The Velveteen Rabbit</i> is the timeless story by Margery Williams that tells the classic tale of how a toy rabbit longed to become real.

This is why young Rachel and her family are especially eager to have their dear elderly neighbor Mrs. Greenberg over for Hanukkah dinner. But every year their neighbor refuses, not wanting to be a bother. One year, on the last night of Hanukkah, Rachel's mother discovers that she has run out of potatoes for the latkes. Maybe Mrs. Greenberg will come for dinner if we borrow some of her potatoes, suggests Rachel. And off she runs into the snowy purple night to see if her plan will work. Author Linda Glaser (<i>Rosie's Birthday Rat</i>) has a keen understanding of a child's perspective: "Mrs. Greenberg's house was always clean and tidy, like its face was just scrubbed and its blouse was tucked in, while Rachel's house always looked like it was still in its pajamas and needed to brush its hair yet." Rachel succeeds in procuring the potatoes, but it takes a "stubborn-as-an-ox" girl to get a "stubborn-as-an-ox" woman to share their Hanukkah dinner. Rachel's ingenious eventual entrapment of Mrs. Greenberg--along with her rosy red cheeks and unruly orange braids--make her an excellent ambassador for a story about the heart of Hanukkah. Lively, cartoonish illustrations by Nancy Cote enliven this already vivacious holiday tale. (Ages 4 and older) <i>--Gail Hudson</i>It&#39;s the last night of Hanukkah, and more relatives are coming than originally planned. Rachel decides to borrow potatoes from Mrs. Greenberg.

John Ross, a Knight of the Word, sworn to fight the eternal battle against mankind's demons, has moved on. But his years spent saving mankind from the horror of the Void have taken their toll. He has lost his spirit, his belief and now it seems he has lost his magic. Working in a hostel for homeless children, his life is now spent fighting a battle in which he feels he might make a difference.<br> But Nest Freemark, whose involvement in those events five years ago shattered her childhood, is about to be drawn once more into the mythic world of the Word and the Void. For she learns that John Ross is in great danger from a demon like no other. And if she doesn't warn him in time - and if he isn't persuaded to take up once more his staff of magic - the battle may be lost for ever.</p></p><p>John Ross, the tortured, conflicted <i>Knight of the Word</i> from Terry Brooks' <i>Running with the Demon</i>, finally gets a good night's sleep in the sequel. He buys this moment's peace at the cost of his sacred oath to be a champion of the Word, renouncing that pledge after failing to prevent the slaughter of a group of schoolchildren. Duty and destiny are difficult to elude, though, and soon his former charge Nest Freemark, now a college student and Olympic hopeful, arrives to warn him of his imminent destruction or, worse still, his unwitting fall into the service of the Void. <p> The story winds lazily through sleepy, wet Seattle like a tour bus, steadily building. Everything eventually converges on the homeless shelter where John works with his new sweetheart Stefanie Winslow for �ber-activist Simon Lawrence, a man his dreams tell him he is fated to kill. A thin mystery clouds the identity of the demon conspiring to deliver John unto evil, but the book's real focus is John's fitful, foot-dragging attempt to fulfil his destiny. <i>Knight of the Word</i> doesn't provide the suspenseful energy of <i>Running</i>, a book that followed Nest through the dramatic loss of her childhood, but it rejoins her as she assumes the responsibilities of young adulthood and--like that period in life--still manages to deliver satisfying, if more subtle, rewards. --<i>Paul Hughes</i></p>His fans should embrace it as eagerly as they have THE SWORD OF SHANNARA (<i>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</i>)<br><br>By far the best of Terry Brook s' many wonderful novels . . .

Despite having a wonderful girlfriend, a downtown Manhattan apartment, and a thriving career, he is afraid that his life is spiraling into &#x201c;nightmarish mediocrity.&#x201d; After obsessing over the notion for years, he finally decides that crossing the island of Cuba on foot might somehow rescue him from the fate he fears. <em>Walking to Guant�namo</em> is the chronicle of that journey. <br><br>And a thoroughly self-deprecating and wry chronicle it is. Rarely has a book about Cuba been so shorn of pretension, ideological blinders, or misplaced romanticism-and hardly ever has it been so genuinely funny. Fleming&#x2019;s vision of the Pearl of the Antilles is, in the phrase of Madison Smartt Bell, truly &#x201c;ground-level.&#x201d; Uninterested in&#x2014;and certainly unfazed by&#x2014;either the hysterical attitude of the US government or the smug pose of the Cuban one, Richard Fleming sets out across Cuba literally one step at a time.<br><br> In doing so, he reveals a popular culture, particularly in music and spiritual life, of deep complexity. A discerning observer of daily life who rejects the clich�s of Cuba&#x2019;s enemies and friends alike, Richard Fleming ranges over the Cuban countryside with a rare ability to distinguish reality from fa�ade and slogan from fact&#x2014;and to do it all in often hilarious if singularly modest style.</p><p>Richard Fleming is an inveterate traveler, photographer, amateur musicologist, sometime deejay, and self-described &#x201c;rabid birdwatcher&#x201d; long enamored of the music, culture, and wild places of the Greater Antilles. Since his graduation from Princeton University in 1987, his work as a sound recordist in documentary film has taken him to the farthest reaches of the globe. He&#x2019;s been around the world with Kofi Annan, flown missions over Kandahar with the US army reserve, followed Imelda Marcos on the presidential campaign trail in the Philippines, camped with geologists in Antarctica, and sweltered on a nuclear aircraft carrier plying the waters of the Persian Gulf. When not on the road, he lives in Brooklyn, New York. <em>Walking to Guant�namo</em> is his first book.<em>Walking to Guant�namo</em> takes the reader on an unblinkered journey deep into the soul of Cuba. It&#x2019;s a colorful and messy place, chock-a-block in splendor and contradiction, sweet music and demagoguery, aspirations and failed promises. Richard Fleming is a winning guide, funny and endowed with a keen eye. He avoids clich�s and tourist traps and homes in on the numinous wonders of an island nation. --Rory Nugent, author of <em>The Search for the Pink-Headed Duck: A Journey into the Himalayas and Down the Brahmaputra </em>and<em> Drums Along the Congo: On the Trail of Mokele-Mbembe, The Last Living Dinosaur</em>.<br><br>Meticulously observed and beautifully expressed, <em>Walking to Guant�namo</em> is a ground-level vision of Cuba.

A Rebel sympathizer&#x2019;s affection for a former Pinkerton detective turned Union agent cannot save him from the horrors of a Richmond prison. A Confederate officer sacrifices his rank to save an actress taken captive while posing as a Union soldier. Overshadowing them all is an actor&#x2019;s outspoken hatred of Abraham Lincoln&#x2014;and a date with destiny that would shock a nation and change the course of history...</p></p><p>John Jakes is to historical American fiction what Stephen King is to horror: a one-man industry. Jakes, the author of over 60 books, including the eight-part Kent Family Chronicles, the North and South Trilogy, and innumerable short stories of the American West, returns to his well-trod Civil War stomping grounds in the engrossing <i>On Secret Service</i>. The story of a war within a war on various levels--the North v. the South, the Union's Pinkerton Detective Agency v. the Confederacy's agent provocateurs, youthful idealism v. youthful lust--<i>On Secret Service</i> chronicles the lives and times of four young Americans, from the war's early tremors in January 1861, through its bloody conclusion, Lincoln's assassination, and John Wilkes Booth's murder in May 1865.<p> The main players are Lon Price, the ardent abolitionist and rising-star operative of the Pinkerton Detective Agency, and Margaret Miller, the beautiful, initially vacuous daughter of the South whose chief concern is that the war be over quickly so as not to interfere with Washington's upcoming social season. After a chance encounter in a Washington park, they are as repulsed by each other's political views as they are drawn together by an undeniable physical chemistry. As hostilities increase, the Pinkertons are pledged to the service of the Union and Lon becomes, ipso facto, a charter member in the U.S. Secret Service. When Margaret's stridently pro-slavery father is gunned down by a Pinkerton operative at a clandestine "Secesh" meeting, Margaret throws off her socialite mantle and vows revenge. She pledges allegiance to the South's most notorious female spy, the wealthy, well-connected, and equally well-endowed Rose Greenhow.</p><p> A parallel relationship develops between Margaret's unlikely best friend, the boyishly slight Hanna Siegel, a devout abolitionist who longs to prove herself on the battlefield, and the conflicted Captain Frederick Dasher, late of West Point, now of the First Virginia Cavalry, and prot�g� to Brigadier General "Jeb" Stuart. Played out before a scrim of battles, lives, fortunes, and reputations won and irreparably lost, Lon, Margaret, Hanna, and Fred cat-and-mouse their way through America's costliest war.</p><p> While the respective outcomes are somewhat predictable, what is not predictable is the degree to which the reader is captivated by Jakes's encyclopedic command of historical fact and his unmatched storytelling. The mingling of well-drawn fictional characters with nicely fleshed-out historical figures raises to rare levels circumstances that would, in lesser hands, seem mere contrivances. <i>--Michael Hudson</i></p>12 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Longarm #429: Longarm and the Lady Lawbreaker</h2><p><b>It&#x2019;s up to Longarm to bring in a vicious vixen...</b><br><br>Hell hath no fury like Naomi Foster, the felonious female that Deputy U.S. Marshal Custis Long has been charged with transporting from Wyoming Territory to Denver for trial.

Stretched. His eyelids fluttered as he fought against sleep. He had to get up soon and head for his own bed. In the meantime he was sated. Maria Lourdes Consuela Valdes lay tucked in close beside him, her breathing slow and steady in the aftermath of their coupling.</p><p>Chill night air cooled the thin film of sweat on his flesh and somewhere on the street below he heard the sounds of a horse&#x2019;s passage. Life could not get much better than this, he thought.</p><p>The deputy United States marshal known as Longarm yawned again and rolled his head to the side. Maria Lourdes&#x2019;s nipple jutted high off her left tit. The woman had the longest nipples he had ever seen. Sensitive, too. He considered toying with this one, but if he did that, he was likely to wake the lady. And Longarm was just too worn-out already to want another piece of that. Maria Lourdes was wild, but she could suck the life out of a man. She certainly had drained Longarm.</p><p>Forcing himself to move, he swiveled onto the side of the feather bed and sat upright. Yawned again and scratched. Then he reached down and silently gathered up his clothes and his boots.</p><p>He padded barefoot out of Maria Lourdes&#x2019;s sleeping chamber to the outer room of her suite and stopped there to dress. He perched on the edge of a flimsy-looking chair to pull on his boots, stood again, and barely remembered in time to stop himself from stamping his feet firmly into the boots lest the noise disturb Maria Lourdes.</p><p>Longarm stretched again and decided maybe he was waking up after all. For a minute or so there it had seemed in doubt.</p><p>There was not enough light in the room to check himself in the mirror as only a very low flame burned in a single lamp, so he had to straighten his collar and tie by feel. And long habit made him check the position of the .45-caliber Colt that rode at his waist, his fingertips finding the polished walnut grips exactly where they should be, just left of his belt buckle with his holster canted for a cross draw.</p><p>Once that was done he declared himself ready to face the world.</p><p>Custis Long stood well over six feet in height, lean and whipcord tough with broad shoulders and narrow hips. His features were craggy, tanned by years of exposure to the elements. He had brown hair and a brown handlebar mustache. His eyes could seem golden brown at times . . . or cold steel at others.</p><p>He wore brown corduroy trousers, a brown tweed coat and checkerboard shirt. His gun belt was black leather, as were his knee-high cavalry boots. On his head he wore a flat-crowned brown Stetson.</p><p>Once into the upstairs hallway in Maria Lourdes&#x2019;s rented house&#x2014;she was in Denver for a month or two to shop, she said&#x2014;he paused to extract a long, slender cheroot from his inside coat pocket. He bit the twist off the tip and deposited the speck of tobacco into a decorative urn on the landing, struck a lucifer, and lighted his smoke, grateful for the flavor of it after being without for some hours. Maria Lourdes, it seemed, did not care for the scent of tobacco.</p><p>On the ground floor he smiled and nodded to one of the lady&#x2019;s housemaids, this one small and dark and wearing a frilly apron over a plain black dress. She had flour up to her wrists and he supposed she was busy setting dough for Maria Lourdes&#x2019;s morning biscuits.</p><p>It must be grand, he thought, to be rich and have a staff of house help to do every little thing for you. It was something he would never know. And really did not care.</p><p>Maria Lourdes&#x2019;s wealth and below-the-border genteel upbringing did not, however, keep her from liking to fuck like a crazed mink. After a very casual meeting in a caf� close to the state capitol building, she had worn Longarm near to a frazzle.</p><p>Not that he minded.</p><p>Now, however, he wanted to go home. Go to bed. And get a deep, if not a long, sleep before he reported in to the office in the morning. He had been idle here in Denver for several weeks now and was looking forward to an assignment.</p><p>He smiled a little, remembering the evening. And the lady. Then he let himself out into the night.</p><p><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p>Longarm woke too late to have breakfast at his boardinghouse. By the time he went downstairs the dining room table had already been cleared and he could hear the sounds of clattering dishes from the kitchen. Not that he wanted anything to eat. His stomach was still bilious after the previous evening&#x2019;s indulgences, and his mouth tasted like someone had shit in it.</p><p>Rather than going out to the street he went out the back way and around to the side of the back porch to where washwater was dumped. A patch of mint grew in the shade there. He bent and plucked a few stems. Chewing them sweetened his mouth considerably.</p><p>From there he walked around to the front of the house and waved to a hansom driver who was sitting in the driving box of his rig half a block distant.</p><p>&#x201c;Federal Building,&#x201d; he ordered as he climbed into the cab.</p><p>&#x201c;Coming right up, gov&#x2019;nor,&#x201d; the driver said. As soon as Longarm closed the cab door the driver snapped his whip above the ears of his horse, and the vehicle lurched into motion, swaying on its leather springs like a ship in a storm.</p><p>It was only a short drive to the imposing, gray-stone U.S. Federal Building on Colfax Avenue.</p><p>Longarm paid the cabbie and tried to rub the sleep out of his eyes before he mounted the broad steps and entered the building.</p><p>The United States marshals&#x2019; office was on the first floor. Longarm pulled the door open and stepped inside.</p><p>&#x201c;Mornin&#x2019;, Henry,&#x201d; he said to the office manager, hanging his Stetson on the hat rack near the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Barely,&#x201d; the bespectacled clerk responded.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Barely morning,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re late.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not very,&#x201d; Longarm said.</p><p>&#x201c;Late enough to annoy the boss. He&#x2019;s been asking for you.&#x201d;</p><p>Longarm immediately brightened and asked hopefully, &#x201c;He has an assignment for me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not for me to say, but I&#x2019;ll tell him you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;</p><p>Longarm snorted. Not for Henry to say, perhaps, but he most certainly knew. Henry knew everything that went on in U.S. Marshal Billy Vail&#x2019;s office. Everything. Maybe everything that went on in the whole building, too, or so it sometimes seemed.</p><p>Henry rose from behind his desk, lightly tapped on the door leading back to Billy&#x2019;s office, paused there for only a moment before he disappeared inside leaving Longarm alone in the outer office. When he emerged again he stopped to gather some papers from his desk before once again entering Billy&#x2019;s private domain. Finally he returned and motioned for Longarm to enter.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2019;Bout time,&#x201d; Longarm mumbled as he went in to see the former Texas Ranger who was his boss.</p><p><b>Chapter 3</b></p><p>Billy Vail&#x2014;United States Marshal William Vail&#x2014;sat behind his desk, bald and almost cherubic in appearance. He looked as though he would be squeamish about stepping on a bug, much less sending a .45 slug into the belly of a man. In fact Vail had more than held his own in the rough-and-ready world of the Texas Rangers before securing this appointment as marshal.</p><p>To his great disgust, once in the job Billy found that the demands of the office kept him mostly behind a desk acting more as an administrator than a hunter of men. He did the job well, though, and his deputies would have followed Vail into the gates of hell itself. Moreover, they knew that if such a thing were ever to become necessary, Billy Vail would be out in front leading the way.</p><p>&#x201c;Mornin&#x2019;, Boss.&#x201d; Longarm fought down an impulse to salute.</p><p>Vail looked up from the papers on his desk and grunted. Loudly. Longarm was not entirely sure how he should interpret that so he kept his mouth shut and waited for Billy to speak.</p><p>Vail took his time about addressing his deputy, who was generally regarded as delivering the best results among the many deputies assigned to the Denver District . . . even if not always by approved methods.</p><p>Finally Billy leaned back, the springs beneath his swivel chair creaking in protest, and laced his fingers behind his head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been sitting around with your thumb up your backside for more than long enough, Custis, so it is about time you get out into the field again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir, I agree,&#x201d; Longarm said.</p><p>&#x201c;I have something for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir, thank you, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Billy grunted again. Swiveled his chair around to face out of the window for a moment, then again swung around to face Longarm. &#x201c;This is not something I would normally give to you, Custis. You tend to go your own way with things and never mind the book. Or plain common sense.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So this time I want you to make an exception. This time I want you to do things exactly the way you are supposed to. No ad libbing, please.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Boss, I don&#x2019;t have any idea what you&#x2019;re talkin&#x2019; about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know something, Custis. Sad as I am to say it, I believe you. You really don&#x2019;t have any grasp of proper law enforcement procedure.&#x201d; Billy shook his head, took a deep breath and went on. &#x201c;We have a new deputy assigned to this office. He needs to be . . . I was about to say he should be broken in, but I&#x2019;m afraid if I do that you will take me at my word and end up really breaking him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, now really, Boss, I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Quiet, please.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What I am asking you to do is simple enough, Custis. I want you to take the young man out with you. The assignment the two of you will complete is simplicity itself. You will pick up a prisoner and transport her back here for trial.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you will do it without trauma or drama or anything else. Just nice and easy and give the young man a taste of the life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As you say, sir.&#x201d; Longarm had learned long ago that a liberal sprinkling of &#x201c;sirs&#x201d; into any conversation tended to keep things calm and took nothing away from the speaker. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve met this, um, new deputy, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;None of us has,&#x201d; Billy said. &#x201c;The reason for that is . . . complicated.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How is that, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Our new deputy is the nephew of a gentleman in Wyoming who is a major player in that territory&#x2019;s push to become a state. He . . . the uncle, that is . . . is the one who secured the young man&#x2019;s appointment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the kid?&#x201d; Longarm asked. &#x201c;Does he want t&#x2019; enforce the law? Or just t&#x2019; wear a badge on his chest an&#x2019; strut around for all the girls t&#x2019; see?&#x201d;</p><p>Billy shrugged. &#x201c;I expect you will find out before I do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come again, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You will be the first to actually meet him. In Cheyenne. You are to go there and, um, pick him up. He will be registered at the Graythorne Inn. You will meet him there and take him with you on a field assignment.&#x201d;</p><p>Longarm raised an eyebrow.</p><p>&#x201c;It is a simple enough thing. You . . . and C. Burton Hood . . . are to proceed to Thermopolis and pick up a prisoner the town marshal is holding for us. Then you will bring the prisoner back here for trial.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And this prisoner?&#x201d; Longarm asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Her name is Naomi Foster. She is accused of stealing from the mail when she was employed as a postal clerk in Buffalo.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Buffalo, New York, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Buffalo, Wyoming Territory,&#x201d; Vail corrected.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah! One o&#x2019; my favorite towns,&#x201d; Longarm said. &#x201c;Anything special about this new deputy that I should know?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;If I knew more I would tell you, Custis.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s already taken the oath?&#x201d; Longarm asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No, not yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you want him t&#x2019; go out with me anyway,&#x201d; Longarm said slowly, chewing on his thoughts as he spoke.</p><p>Billy nodded. &#x201c;I do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;An&#x2019; you want me t&#x2019; handle things strictly by the book this time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;</p><p>Longarm sighed. &#x201c;The Graythorne Inn in Cheyenne. C. Burton Hood.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; Billy leaned back in his chair. Longarm was not entirely positive, but he thought the boss had a look about him, something on the order of a cat with a fluff of canary feathers around its mouth. There was something&#x2014;Longarm did not know what&#x2014;that Billy was not telling him. But that he was expected to figure out on his own.</p><p>&#x201c;An&#x2019; this Thermopolis place, Boss. Where the hell is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is approximately at the end of the earth. Somewhere between the Big Horns and the Wind River Reservation,&#x201d; Vail said. &#x201c;Luckily for you, there is a stagecoach that runs there. You can take the train west to Rawlins and a stagecoach north from there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And, um, good luck, Custis.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Boss. Not that I expect t&#x2019; need luck on a simple assignment like this,&#x201d; Longarm said.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope you are right about that, Custis. Now see Henry on your way out. He has your travel papers in hand.&#x201d;</p><p>Again Longarm had to resist that impulse to salute as he turned and headed out of the office.</p><p><b>Chapter 4</b></p><p>Longarm had plenty of time to think on his way to Cheyenne. He concluded that Billy&#x2019;s plan was not a matter of being devious&#x2014;although the boss was certainly capable of that if or when need be&#x2014;but of good management.</p><p>The prisoner being a woman, standard operating procedure was that whenever possible two deputies be assigned to transport her. That was to avoid any claims later by some lying bitch that she had been molested while she was in custody. Longarm had seen that sort of thing happen more than once. One of those times the lie nearly ruined the career of a good man.</p><p>By sending this untried youngster C. Burton Hood on the detail, Billy could comply with that procedure without wasting the services of two good deputies. Instead he sent his top deputy and the kid. The prisoner need never know that Hood was not a sworn officer.</p><p>That had to be in Billy&#x2019;s mind when he handed out the assignment, Longarm concluded.</p><p>Still, Billy had looked . . . well, damnit, he had looked devious back there in Denver. Was there something about this deal that Longarm did not yet understand? Could be, he conceded with a sigh. Whatever came, though, would have to play out however it chose. All Longarm could do was his duty.</p><p>That much decided, he got up and walked back to the smoking car where he found a steward who was serving a decent brand of whiskey and a table of gentlemen playing a friendly game of low-stakes poker.</p><p>&#x201c;Got room for another?&#x201d; Longarm asked, drink in one hand and cheroot in the other.</p><p>&#x201c;Welcome, friend. Sit down and join us.&#x201d;</p><p>Longarm stuck his cigar between his teeth at a jaunty angle and grinned as he sat.</p><p><b>Chapter 5</b></p><p>&#x201c;I am sorry, sir. Mr. Hood is out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Any idea when he&#x2019;ll be back?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir, none.&#x201d;</p><p>Longarm grunted his disappointment, then said, &#x201c;All right. Reckon I&#x2019;ll wait.&#x201d; He picked up his carpetbag and headed for the bank of easy chairs arranged in the Graythorne Inn&#x2019;s lobby.</p><p>&#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; the desk clerk called to him.</p><p>Longarm stopped. Turned. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know when Mr. Hood will return, but . . . it could be morning. Or later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see. All right, thanks.&#x201d; Longarm changed direction back out toward the street. It was obvious from the look of the place that the Graythorne was more expensive than Henry would allow on his expense account when he returned to Denver. He needed to find something he&#x2014;and the government&#x2014;could afford.</p><p>Past experience led him back toward Front Street and th...</p></p><h2>The Adventures of Sophie Mouse 3 Books in 1!: A New Friend; The Emerald Berries; Forget-Me-Not Lake</h2><p>The first three books in The Adventures of Sophie Mouse series are now available in one enchanting paperback bind-up!<br><br>Join Sophie Mouse and her forest friends in Silverlake Forest as they make a new friend, look for special emerald berries, and learn to swim at Forget-Me-Not Lake in this all-in-one paperback edition!<br> <br>With easy-to-read language and illustrations on almost every page, the Adventures of Sophie Mouse chapter books are perfect for beginning readers.<br> <br>This fantastic three-book bind-up includes <i>A New Friend</i>, <i>The Emerald Berries</i>, and <i>Forget-Me-Not Lake</i>.</p><p>Poppy Green can talk to animals!

The lessons she discloses come from fields as diverse as ecology, evolution, and cell biology. Written in the form of a Platonic dialogue among five fictional characters, <i>The Nature of Economies</i> is as astonishingly accessible and clear as it is irrepressibly brilliant and wise&#x2013;a groundbreaking yet humane study destined to become another world-altering classic.</p><p>Over the past 40 years, Jane Jacobs has produced an acclaimed series of analytical essays that examine the development of complex human systems and environments in a manner that's as literary as it is visionary. Her latest, <i>The Nature of Economies</i>, continues this artistic and provocative tradition by dissecting relationships between economics and ecology through a multilayered discourse around the fundamental premise that "human beings exist wholly within nature as part of a natural order." In a style reminiscent of the cinematic <i>My Dinner with Andre</i>, Jacobs gives us a captivating ongoing conversation between five contemporary New Yorkers who sip coffee and voice accepted, fact-based theories along with subjective but solid opinions regarding the way our society's fractal-like development is actually dependent upon "the same universal principles that the rest of nature uses." Digressing onto various and sundry paths as such dialogues always do--albeit, this time, on a very specific and methodical route as prescribed by Jacobs--the characters mull over business cycles, animal husbandry, habitat destruction, the implications of standardization and monopoly, competition in nature, the obsolescence of computers, and much, much more. This book is recommended for the eclectically curious who welcome the opportunity to eavesdrop on such stimulating table talk, even while lamenting the fact they can't join in. --<i>Howard Rothman</i>"Provocative...engaging.... [Jacobs] is the archetypal iconoclast."&#x2013;<i>The</i> <i>Boston Book Review</i></p><h2>Galatians, Ephesians (NT Volume 10) (Reformation Commentary on Scripture Series, NT Volume 10)</h2><p>The gospel of justification by faith alone was discovered afresh by the Reformers in the epistolary turrets of the New Testament: the letters to the Galatians and the Ephesians. At the epicenter of the exegetical revolution that rocked the Reformation era was Paul&#39;s letter to the Galatians. There Luther, Calvin, Bullinger and scores of others perceived the true gospel of Paul enlightening a situation parallel to their own times--the encroachment of false teachers and apostates upon the true teaching of salvation by grace through faith. In Ephesians, the Reformers gravitated to what they understood to be the summit of Paul&#39;s vision of salvation in Christ. Finding its source, beyond time, in the electing love of God, the Reformers disseminated the letter?s message of temporal hope for Christians living under the duress of persecution. For the Reformers, these epistles were living, capsule versions of Paul&#39;s letter to the Romans, briefs on the theological vision of the celebrated apostle. Probed and expounded in the commentaries and sermons found in this volume, these letters became the very breath in the lungs of the Reformation movements. The range of comment on Galatians and Ephesians here spans Latin, German, French, Dutch and English authors from a variety of streams within the Protestant movement. Especially helpful in this volume is Gerald Bray&#39;s editorial presentation of the development of tensions among the Reformers. The epistles of Galatians and Ephesians open up a treasure house of ancient wisdom, allowing these faithful Reformation witnesses to speak with eloquence and intellectual acumen to the church today.</p><p><strong>Volume Editor</strong><strong>Gerald L.

Manetsch</strong> (Ph.D., University of Arizona) is associate professor of church history at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and author of <em>Theodore Beza and the Quest for Peace in France, 1572-1598.</em>"Like the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, the Reformation Commentary on Scripture does a masterful job of offering excellent selections from well-known and not-so-well-known exegetes. The editor's introductory survey is, by itself, worth the price of the book. It is easy to forget that there were more hands, hearts and minds involved in the Reformation than Luther and Calvin. Furthermore, encounters even with these figures are often limited to familiar quotes on familiar topics. However, the Reformation Commentary helps us to recognize the breadth and depth of exegetical interests and skill that fueled and continue to fuel faithful meditation on God's Word. I heartily recommend this series as a tremendous resource not only for ministry but for personal edification." (Michael S. Horton, J. G. Machen Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics, Westminster Seminary, California)<br><br>"Why was this not done before? The publication of the Reformation Commentary on Scripture should be greeted with enthusiasm by every believing Christian--but especially by those who will preach and teach the Word of God. This commentary series brings the very best of the Reformation heritage to the task of exegesis and exposition, and each volume in this series represents a veritable feast that takes us back to the sixteenth century to enrich the preaching and teaching of God's Word in our own time." (R. Albert Mohler Jr., president, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary)<br><br>"The Reformers discerned rightly what the church desperately needed in the sixteenth century--the bold proclamation of the Word based on careful study of the sacred Scriptures. We need not only to hear that same call again for our own day, but also to learn from the Reformation how to do it. This commentary series is a godsend!" (Richard J. Mouw, president, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Protestant reformers were fundamentally exegetes as much as theologians, yet (except for figures like Luther and Calvin) their commentaries and sermons have been neglected because these writings are not available in modern editions or languages. That makes this new series of Reformation Commentary on Scripture most welcome as a way to provide access to some of the wealth of biblical exposition of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The editor?s introduction explains the nature of the sources and the selection process; the intended audience of modern pastors and students of the Bible has led to a focus on theological and practical comments. Although it will be of use to students of the Reformation, this series is far from being an esoteric study of largely forgotten voices; this collection of reforming comments, comprehending every verse and provided with topical headings, will serve contemporary pastors and preachers very well." (Elsie Anne McKee, Archibald Alexander Professor of Reformation Studies and the History of Worship, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Discerning the true significance of movements in theology requires acquaintance with their biblical exegesis. This is supremely so with the Reformation, which was essentially a biblical revival. The Reformation Commentary on Scripture will fill a yawning gap, just as the Ancient Christian Commentary did before it, and the first volume gets the series off to a fine start, whetting the appetite for more. Most heartily do I welcome and commend this long overdue project." (J. I. Packer, Board of Governors Professor of Theology, Regent College)<br><br>"The format of this volume makes it eminently usable either for extended reading or for single reference for devotional or scholarly purpose." (James L. Boyce, Lutheran Quarterly, Volume XXVII (2013))<br><br>"The Reformation Commentary on Scripture is a major publishing event--for those with historical interest in the founding convictions of Protestantism, but even more for those who care about understanding the Bible. As with IVP Academic's earlier Ancient Christian Commentary, this effort brings flesh and blood to 'the communion of saints' by letting believers of our day look over the shoulders of giants from the past. By connecting the past with the present, and by doing so with the Bible at the center, the editors of this series perform a great service for the church. The series deserves the widest possible support." (Mark A. Noll, Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History, University of Notre Dame)<br><br>"I strongly endorse the Reformation Commentary on Scripture. Introducing how the Bible was interpreted during the age of the Reformation, these volumes will not only renew contemporary preaching but they will also help us understand more fully how reading and meditating on Scripture can, in fact, change our lives!" (Lois Malcolm, associate professor of systematic theology, Luther Seminary)<br><br>"The Reformation Commentary on Scripture series promises to be an 'open sesame' to the biblical exegesis, exposition and application of the Bible that was the hallmark of the Reformation. While comparisons can be odious, the difference between Reformation commentary and exposition and much that both preceded and followed it is laid bare in these pages: whereas others write about the Bible from the outside, Reformation exposition carries with it the atmosphere of men who spoke and wrote from inside the Bible, experiencing the power of biblical teaching even as they expounded it. . . . This grand project sets before scholars, pastors, teachers, students and growing Christians an experience that can only be likened to stumbling into a group Bible study only to discover that your fellow participants include some of the most significant Christians of the Reformation and post-Reformation (for that matter, of any) era. Here the Word of God is explained in a variety of accents: German, Swiss, French, Dutch, English, Scottish and more. Each one vibrates with a thrilling sense of the living nature of God's Word and its power to transform individuals, churches and even whole communities. Here is a series to anticipate, enjoy and treasure." (Sinclair Ferguson, senior minister, First Presbyterian Church, Columbia, South Carolina)<br><br>"Today more than ever, the Christian past is the church's future. InterVarsity Press has already brought the voice of the ancients to our ears. Now, in the Reformation Commentary on Scripture, we hear a timely word from the first Protestants as well."

I appreciate seeing a picture of the author and reading about the author's life and work. This gives me a sense of who the writer is and gives me a deeper connection with the book.</p> <p>Creating jewelry from beautiful gemstones is a highly personal spiritual experience for me. In my work I draw deeply on my life experience and what I've learned during my spiritual journey in response to my life challenges. Perhaps reading about how my work grew out of my life course will help you to understand what I strive to achieve in my work, and you will better see how Jewelry for the Soul can help you on your own journey.</p> <p><strong>My Fascination with Ethnic Jewelry</strong> <br>I spent fourteen years of my early life in Cologne, Germany, the cultural capital of the Rhineland, with its beautiful medieval cathedral, thirty-one museums, and Germany's largest arts fair. When I discovered the museums and all their beautiful collections of jewelry from other times and places on the Earth, I was utterly enchanted and touched by the art from the Egyptians, Etruscan, American Indians, Greeks, Celts, and the Roman Empire. From then on, my own European heritage has greatly influenced my work as a jeweler.</p> <p>I decided I wanted to pursue a trade that would allow me to be self-employed and express myself creatively. I was drawn to jewelry making for the intimate, personal connection I felt with jewelry: you admire it, enjoy it, and wear it on your body.</p> <p><strong>Apprenticeship and Studies <br></strong>In Germany there is a long tradition of apprenticeship in the crafts, reaching back to the Middle Ages. I began my apprenticeship at age twenty-one at a master jeweler's studio in the outskirts of Cologne, working under harsh conditions in a cold cellar. But I was an independent-minded young woman with a vision for my future. After a year and a half, I left my apprenticeship and began studies at Fachhochschule f�r Kunst und Design in Cologne. I'd miraculously been chosen out of hundreds of applicants for an art and jewelry class of just ten students.</p> <p>I knew clearly that jewelry making was my passion and my future and I was determined to learn it.</p> <p>My most important teacher, Mechtild Baumann, was in her forties and an accomplished master jeweler, and I was a young woman of twenty-two in need of a mentor. She befriended me and took me under her wing, and this became a very fruitful relationship. I went to study and work with her at her studio and home in Cologne, and it was Mechtild who taught me true goldsmithing.</p> <p>Under the medieval guild system, a craftsman became a journeyman upon finishing an apprenticeship. For a period of at least five years, the journeyman would travel from town to town, looking for work with different masters in order to perfect his skills. Only after further training and taking an exam could the journeyman achieve the level of master. In accordance with that long tradition, I signed a new contract with Mechtild, finished out my apprenticeship with her, and successfully passed my final exam to become a journeywoman.</p> <p>I have precious memories of the time I spent with Mechtild. We were together the entire day, from morning to night. She was my guardian angel and a wonderful teacher. She not only taught me jewelry-making techniques, but opened my eyes and my heart to a deeper level of the craft that had been lacking in my previous training. She had piles of books about ancient cultures and their jewelry making. We would spend the day at the bench with a big pot of tea between us, working, investigating those books, listening to the music of legendary jazz and New Age musician Paul Horn, and discussing the meaning of life.</p> <p><strong>Finding a Spiritual Path</strong> <br>I was brought up in a religious family-my grandfather was a Protestant minister-and I had a spiritual orientation in life even as a child. I always felt an inner connection to God.</p> <p>As a Gemini rising, I am compelled to constantly learn about a great many things that awaken my curiosity. That thirst for knowledge took me on a journey that immersed me in spirituality and a quest to understand how I could express my spirituality through my work. Mechtild used to say that her art was her spiritual path. At that time I didn't really grasp what that meant for her, but as I explored my own spirituality through my art, I began to understand. Today I know that sitting at my jeweler's bench with awareness, presence, and openness to my own being is integrating spirituality into my daily life. I feel very connected and joyful in the process of creation. I love feeling connected to something larger than my ego identity.</p> <p>From my beginning in art school, I had studied symbols and sacred geometry-the spiritual meaning of the patterns found in nature, from the tiniest things to the cosmos-which led me to learn about astrology. Astrology is one of the oldest systems of seeing and interpreting the world through symbols. It is a system of divination, the discovering of hidden knowledge. Astrology opened my eyes to a vast new world.</p> <p>I also encountered teachers from all over the world who worked with the healing aspects of crystals and gemstones. My first teacher in the area of healing with gemstones was Daya Chocron, who wrote the first book on this topic many years ago. At about that time, I had a very striking experience in a meditation with a Rubellite Tourmaline. I felt an all-encompassing love spreading throughout my body, especially my heart. My being was filled with sweetness and joy. When I later read about the qualities of Rubellite, I was amazed at how accurate my vision had been. This experience opened me up to the metaphysical world of gemstones and my direct experience convinced me of the energy they contained.</p> <p>Another teacher I was fortunate to meet was scientist Marcel Vogel, an IBM researcher who developed the first liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and went on to investigate the healing properties of crystals and become a well-known healer. He created ways of cutting crystals to enhance their powers for healing purposes. I met him at several seminars and was invited by him to do research at his laboratory in San Jos�, California. This was my first visit to the United States, in the 1990s.</p> <p>Others I met started out as healers or spiritual teachers and then began to use crystals to enhance transmission of their own healing energy. Some used crystals for meditation or laid them in healing patterns on the body. What I learned from these teachers allowed me to deepen my knowledge of healing and my connection to my own inner being.</p> <p>Astrology is both a science and an art form. Anyone can learn the science of astrology, but to apply that science to help people understand the forces at work in their lives, it is necessary to develop a degree of psychic skill as well as communication skill to convey those concepts to people who are seeking understanding.</p> <p>I always knew I could read people very well. I am able to reach down to subtle levels of people, to sense their inner being, who they are. Sometimes I would see images of them in different settings, like past lives. When I give an astrological reading, I tune in through the chart and have a pretty good feel for how it applies to the client. When I began to work with gemstones, I could hold a stone and tune into it and know its qualities and feel them in my body.</p> <p>During my training as a jeweler I sought to further develop these psychic skills to enhance my art and the lives of my clients. I learned chakra reading (interpreting the energetic imprints in a person's energy field) with psychic healers.</p> <p>I was passionate about being a jeweler and excited to discover the deeper meanings of jewelry beyond its simple surface beauty. My loose schedule in art school gave me ample time to pursue my own research and my personal spiritual journey.</p> <p>After five years of study, I passed my final exam and became a certified artist, which enabled me to be self-employed as a jewelry artist in Germany.</p> <p><strong>Gallery Phoenix</strong><br>I used to live in an old neighborhood in the center of Cologne. One day on my way home I came across a small shop that seemed to be empty. I thought this might be a wonderful little shop for a jewelry gallery. I christened it "Gallery Phoenix."</p> <p>The shop took off almost immediately. Six months later I had another jeweler working for me, and then a second one. Two years later I moved next door to a much larger and nicer gallery space and had five employees.</p> <p>I very much enjoyed both my work and the success of the gallery. What I found most satisfying at my gallery in Cologne was creating jewelry that had deep personal meaning for people. I learned to create Soul Jewelry that connects us to the spirit and deeper level of our soul, where it becomes an expression of who we are as a being. My clients were involved in the process of design and picking out stones for healing, balance, or expansion into higher aspects of themselves. I gave them an astrological reading, showed them their healing stones, and then designed a very personal piece of Soul Jewelry for them.</p> <p>In the seven years that I owned my gallery in Cologne, I gave about a thousand astrology readings and many seminars all over Germany about using gemstones and crystals to enhance healing and meditation. This afforded me a great deal of experience and feedback from my clients and others who used gems and crystals in their lives. I heard some amazing stories from them. I had very beautiful and deep connections with people I met through this aspect of my work and found many friends.</p> <p>In 1994, without a specific plan in mind, knowing only that I needed to take the next step on my journey, I sold the gallery to my partner and moved on into an unknown future. I did some traveling around the world, met more spiritual teachers and healers, and did a lot of soul searching and growing.</p> <p>My search was to understand how the human mind functions, how to heal trauma, and how to recondition ourselves to live deeper lives. I became very interested in Tibetan Buddhism and saw the Dalai Lama and Tibetan lamas. I did not adopt that path, though, because I sensed that it was very complex and foreign to my Western mind. I did Zen meditation retreats, but found those to be too rigid (and hard on my back!). I learned about Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP) and hypnotherapy from masters such as Tony Robbins and Eli Jaxon-Bear, and I presented introductory seminars in NLP myself. I traveled to India several times, learning from a Siddha yoga master teacher in Kerala, South India, and went to the Oneness University near Chennai.</p> <p>All of these experiences added to my understanding and deepened my own connection with the divine.</p> <p><strong>Hawaii, Love, and Soul Jewelry</strong> <br>I had been to Maui in 1991 for a seminar and had fallen in love with the island. I returned here in 1995 initially for a sabbatical and to write. Then I met Will, a jeweler who specialized in creating the most beautiful jewelry with natural crystals. I had done some work with crystals in Germany, but in general it is very unusual for jewelers to work with natural crystals rather than cut stones. Happily, my plan to stay in Hawaii for only one year was foiled by falling in love with Will! Our two souls recognized each other instantly. We embarked on a new life and a new business together here on Maui. And that is how I came to live and work in paradise with my husband.</p> <p>Will and I have been happily living on Maui for thirteen years now, working in our home studio on the slopes of Haleakala Mountain, an ancient dormant volcano. Maui is a truly magical place. Astrologically it is a place of Pluto (transformation) and Venus (love and art). Maui is <br>home to a great variety of artists: our many writers, painters, jewelers, sculptors, and woodworkers find that the island is a conductor that frees creative energies and helps them to manifest their visions.</p> <p>When I first came here, I was very deeply touched by the spirit and beauty of the island. I am awed by the beauty of nature in all its different forms. From our house we have a view over the West Maui Mountains, surrounded by the ocean, and we watch the most breathtaking sunsets here almost every evening. The colors here are very intense: the blue of the sky and the ocean, the greens of the tropical plants, the bright colors of the flowers. I started painting here with oils and a pallet knife, trying to catch the beauty around me.</p> <p>Maui is called the island of aloha, a Hawaiian word that means "sharing the breath of life." It is a greeting of unconditional love, which I find expressed in the friendliness and close relationships of the people here.</p> <p>Apprentices have come from all over the world to learn jewelry making with me. It feels good to pass on some of what I have learned and received over the years. Happily, I am back at the bench myself, creating jewelry with my own hands. I have come full circle with the teachings of my most cherished mentor, Mechtild, to find that jewelry making is a spiritual journey and a sacred act.</p> <p>I create my own jewelry with attention to harmony of form, conscious use of metals, and, of course, colorful combinations of gemstones. I also do personal counseling and Gemstone Profiles for people who are interested in discovering the gemstones that heal, nurture, and support them. Occasionally I lead weekend seminars on Meditation and Healing with Gemstones and Crystals and hold Oneness Deeksha events. You can find all kinds of creations from my heart to yours at my web-site, www.shaktijewelry.com.</p> <p>I lead a quiet life where there is time to meditate, sit with my cat, work in the garden, and continue my inner spiritual work, which is most important for me. I feel nourished by the beauty all around me and feel very grateful for where my life's journey has brought me.</p> <p>In this book, I share with you the spiritual principles and information about gemstones and crystals that have brought beauty, insight, and energy into my own life for over thirty years so that you may engage more deeply and with greater joy in your own life journey.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Dreaming Brain</h2><p>Surveys modern brain research, and argues that dreams are transparent psychological phenomena resulting from brain activity on the molecular and cellular levels</p><p><b>J. Allan Hobson</b> is professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Laboratory of Neurophysiology, Massachusetts Mental Health Center.Dismissing both Freudian and Jungian dream analysis as unscientific, Hobson claims dreams are the vast maintenance task of the brain, an enormously complex information processing machine. In his physiological theory, sensory and motor signals generated by the brain during sleep are the driving forces behind the dream plot; the sleeper's past experiences, wishes and attitudes then come into play, shaping the dream material. Hobson draws on clinical studies of sleep and a scientist's 1939 dream journal for support. His "activation-synthesis" model of dreaming leaves room for creativitydreams facilitate comparison of old and new information and the consolidation of memories. In this study, the author, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, rejects Freud in favor of Spanish anatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal, founder of modern neurobiology, for whom the unconscious was an intrinsic part of the brain-mind system. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Young Guinevere</h2><p>Set in Medieval Europe, this is Robert San Souci&#39;s magical tale of Guinevere--from her childhood to her marriage to King Arthur. When Guinevere&#39;s father&#39;s castle is besieged by invaders, she must travel through the forest and cross the perilous river in search of young King Arthur. Their fateful meeting leads to the fulfillment of Guinevere&#39;s destiny and her betrothal to King Arthur.</p><p>In a rather long text for the picture book format, San Souci ( Feathertop ; Young Merlin ) draws on an amalgam of sources to portray the young princess as she explores the enchanted forest around her father's castle and as she ultimately saves the kingdom from destruction. All the ingredients prized by fantasy aficionados are here: the prophecy of Guinevere's marriage to Arthur, the unicorn in the woods, the hideous monster Guinevere outwits, the heraldic splendor of the battle for control of England, the heroine's brave journey to summon her future husband to arms. Although the extensively researched text evokes the glamour and danger of legends of the Middle Ages, it occasionally becomes self-consciously weighty. As a result, characters are little more than stock gothic types, which befits the grand scale of oral epic but is ill-suited to the more intimate scope of a picture book. Henterly's ( Good King Wenceslas ) lavish full-page artwork in rich jewel tones is, like the text, best when confined to small detail work. The exquisite spot illustrations embody all the beauty and delicacy of the tapestries they are meant to suggest. However, the sweeping large-scale paintings may appear overly commercial for some tastes, conjuring up visions of florid romance novel covers. Ages 7-11. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 3-5-- Hardly a junior Mists of Avalon (Ballantine, 1985), this large picture book pays welcome attention to a female figure--the central female--in the Arthurian cycle. The motherless daughter of a king, Guinevere spends her maiden days embroidering or wandering in the forest with her bow. She shoots a wolf, then discovers and treats the shape-changing, wild boy she has wounded. Later the wolf/boy helps her evade a siege of her father's castle, escape a dragonlike beast, and seek aid from the court of King Arthur. Arthur falls in love with her, but she overhears Merlin warn him that their marriage could be disastrous. When the young king decides to take that risk, the story ends happily, with Guinevere riding off to her wedding. (A postscript summarizes the later developments in her story.) Henterley's illustrations are traditional and romantic, rich in color and detail, although the figures are sometimes a bit stiff or flat. The decorative elements, drawing on Kells-period design, and the spot illustrations, modeled on the Bayeux Tapestry, are particularly successful. The appeal of the pictures should lure readers to this book, which may in turn springboard a few to more complex treatments of Arthurian material. --Patricia Dooley, University of Washington, Seattle<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Under the Cherry Blossom Tree: An Old Japanese Tale</h2><p>Spring had finally come and everyone in the village was happy, despite being poor - everyone except the miserly landlord. Mumbling and grumbling, he sat all alone eating a bowl of cherries and glaring as the villagers sang and danced in the meadow. Then, quite by accident, he swallowed a cherry pit. The pit began to sprout. Soon the landlord was the wonder of the village - a cherry tree was growing on top of his head! What happened to the cherry tree and to the wicked landlord is a favorite joke in Japan. Allen Say tells the story with wit and vitality, and his beautiful drawings complement this classic Japanese tale.</p><p><p>Allen Say was born in Yokohama, Japan, in 1937. He dreamed of becoming a cartoonist from the age of six, and, at age twelve, apprenticed himself to his favorite cartoonist, Noro Shinpei. For the next four years, Say learned to draw and paint under the direction of Noro, who has remained Say's mentor. Say illustrated his first children's book -- published in 1972 -- in a photo studio between shooting assignments. For years, Say continued writing and illustrating children's books on a part-time basis. But in 1987, while illustrating THE BOY OF THE THREE-YEAR NAP (Caldecott Honor Medal), he recaptured the joy he had known as a boy working in his master's studio. It was then that Say decided to make a full commitment to doing what he loves best: writing and illustrating children's books. Since then, he has written and illustrated many books, including TREE OF CRANES and GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY, winner of the 1994 Caldecott Medal. He is a full-time writer and illustrator living in Portland, Oregon.</p>&#34;Allen Say retells a classic makura -- a short story told in Japanese joke houses to warm up the audience -- with the sharpness, vigor and timing of a stand-up comic.&#34; Publishers Weekly</p><h2>Jack: Secret Vengeance (Repairman Jack)</h2><p><p>Everyone loves senior Carson Toliver, the captain and quarterback of the football team, heartthrob of South Burlington County Regional High&#x2015;especially the girls.

He saw <em>8:13</em>in glowing red numbers. He squinted at his window. A cloudy morning sky peeked around the edge of the drawn shade.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call her back.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She says it&#x2019;s important.&#x201d;<br>What could be important at eight thirteen on a Sunday morning?<br>Groaning, he slid out of bed, pulled on his jeans, and padded barefoot down the hall past his brother&#x2019;s and sister&#x2019;s empty bedrooms. Tom was finishing law school in Jersey City and Kate had started med school in Stratford. He veered right, into the kitchen where his mother was cracking eggs, and picked up the receiver lying on the counter.<br>&#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;<br><em>&#x201c;Jack, I need to talk to you. Real bad.&#x201d;</em><br>&#x201c;Well, hello, stranger.&#x201d;<br>Except for brief conversations at the school bus stop, they hadn&#x2019;t seen too much of each other lately.<br><em>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious, Jack. I really need to talk.&#x201d;</em><br>Something in her voice ... he couldn&#x2019;t put his finger on it, but he sensed she was upset. She didn&#x2019;t get along too well with her folks, especially her dad. Weezy was a little too strange for him. Maybe a lot too strange.<br>Not too strange for Jack. She was just ... Weezy.<br>Maybe they&#x2019;d had a blowup.<br>&#x201c;Okay. Want to come over for breakfast?&#x201d;<br><em>&#x201c;No. I don&#x2019;t want anyone else listening in.

I&#x2019;ll try for twenty.&#x201d;<br><em>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</em><br>He smiled as he hung up. Now what? Never a dull moment with Weezy Connell. And Jack wouldn&#x2019;t have it any other way.<br>He heard voices coming from the living room&#x2014;first a man&#x2019;s, then a woman&#x2019;s. Radio? TV? His folks never played either on Sunday morning. This was newspaper time. If they played anything, it was one of Mom&#x2019;s Broadway soundtracks. He went to check and found his father seated before the TV, leaning forward, eyes glued to the screen.<br>And on that screen&#x2014;a pile of burning, smoking rubble with fire trucks and ambulances milling around. A caption said <em>Beirut, Lebanon.</em>The little CNN logo sat in the lower right corner.<br>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br>Dad looked up, his expression grim. &#x201c;See that pile of concrete? That was a four-story marine barrack until some crazy Arabs blew it up.&#x201d;<br>Jack stared at the rubble. Four stories? It was barely one now.<br>&#x201c;An air raid?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. Word coming out is some nutcase drove a truckload of explosives through the front door and blew it up.&#x201d;<br>Jack blinked. &#x201c;With himself still in it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah. What they&#x2019;re calling a &#x2018;suicide bombing.&#x2019; Same thing happened to a French barracks a few miles away. They think the dead count is going to reach three hundred.&#x201d;<br>Jack was aghast.<br>&#x201c;Are they crazy? I mean, blowing themselves up?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, the kamikaze pilots during World War Two went on suicide missions, but that was in battle, during a war. These kids were all part of a peacekeeping force.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But ... why?&#x201d; He couldn&#x2019;t fathom anyone doing this.<br>&#x201c;Who knows? Some reporter said it was like Pearl Harbor&#x2014;a sneak attack at dawn on a Sunday morning. But the Japs had the decency to declare war first. And they had a country and an army and a navy we could strike back at. Some group called Islamic Jihad is taking credit for this. Who the hell are they? No one seems to know a thing about them, except they also claimed credit for that U.S. Embassy bomb back in April.&#x201d;<br>Jack had heard about that but had been only peripherally aware of it. This seemed different, and was so much worse.

Gaius Julius Caesar is sweeping through Gaul. While his victories in the name of Rome are epic, the conservative leaders of the Republic are not pleased -- they are terrified. Where will the boundless ambition of Rome's most brilliant soldier stop? He must be destroyed before he can overthrow the government and install himself as Dictator. </p><p>When Cato and the Senate betray him, Caesar resolves to turn his genius against his ungrateful country. Backed by a loyal and skilled army, he marches on Rome. But before reaching his goal, he must contend with Pompey the Great, a formidable adversary who underestimates the renegade Caesar. </p><p>These are tumultuous times -- for Caesar, who endures personal tragedies even as he wages war; for Pompey, who must wrestle with his fear that his greatness is at an end; for Cicero, whose luminous rhetoric is shattered by threat of violence; and for the citizens of Rome, whose destiny lies in Caesar's hands. </p><p>The fifth novel in Colleen McCullough's unforgettable Masters of Rome series, <i>Caesar</i> brings to life the passion and genius of an incomparable man.</p></p><p>Colleen McCullough enjoys worldwide renown and her novels are bestsellers in a multitude of languages. She is the author of <i>The Thorn Birds, Tim, An Indecent Obsession, A Greed for the Third Millennium, The Ladies of Missalongi, The First Man in Rome, The Grass Crown, Fortunes Favorites,</i> and <i>Caesar's Women.</i> She lives with her husband, Ric Robinson, on Norfolk Island in the South Pacific.McCullough continues her Masters of Rome series; in this fifth installment, the leaders of Rome plot to stop Caesar, fearing that his victories in Gaul will inspire him to proclaim himself dictator. Amazingly, this abridgment doesn&#39;t seem lacking, thanks in large part to Michael York&#39;s energetic and empathic narration. Using regional British accents to differentiate a large cast of characters, he maintains the energy and spirit that take the listener through the machinations and plotting of all involved. The emotions are real and fresh--for example, Caesar&#39;s grief at the deaths of his mother and daughters and Pompey&#39;s fears and jealousies at Caesar&#39;s mounting victories. Skillful abridgment and a masterful narrator make this engrossing to the end. M.A.M.

When France and Germany unite against America, Britain and the Eastern European democracies, the former Soviet Union is caught in the middle of a trade war that turns into a shooting war.</p><p>Fans will no doubt lap up the latest techno-thriller from Bond and Patrick Larkin, the team responsible for Vortex and Red Phoenix . In late 1997, world order has been destabilized by recession and extreme nationalism. The French foreign minister creates "EurCon," a European Confederation led by France and Germany that will rule Europe. EurCon's attempt to assimilate Eastern Europe meets with resistance, particularly from Poland, and soon the U.S. and Britain are pulled into the struggle. The war and its build-up are reported by various observers: the senior CIA field man in Moscow, the private advisor to the U.S. president, a French intelligence agent, a Hungarian police commander, a Russian intelligence man, a CIA economist (the lone woman and hence the "like" interest) and officers of the American, German and Polish armed forces. The French are definitely the bad guys here, albeit dim ones who don't see the writing on the wall when the Americans wipe out their nuclear capability two-thirds through the book. The prose serves the galloping plot and technology well, if humorlessly; maps, dramatis personae and a glossary also help. But the last chapter--"New Beginnings"--is too warm and fuzzy and should have been dropped.

Narrated by Francia DiMase.</p><p>"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth," warns Ecclesiastes 7:4, and so does the novel by Edith Wharton that takes its title from this call to heed. New York at the turn of the century was a time of opulence and frivolity for those who could afford it. But for those who couldn't and yet wanted desperately to keep up with the whirlwind, like Wharton's charming Lily Bart, it was something else altogether: a gilded cage rather than the Gilded Age. <p> One of Wharton's earliest descriptions of her heroine, in the library of her bachelor friend and sometime suitor Lawrence Selden, indicates that she appears "as though she were a captured dryad subdued to the conventions of the drawing room." Indeed, herein lies Lily's problem. She has, we're told, "been brought up to be ornamental," and yet her spirit is larger than what this ancillary role requires. By today's standards she would be nothing more than a mild rebel, but in the era into which Wharton drops her unmercifully, this tiny spark of character, combined with numerous assaults by vicious society women and bad luck, ultimately renders Lily persona non grata. Her own ambivalence about her position serves to open the door to disaster: several times she is on the verge of "good" marriage and squanders it at the last moment, unwilling to play by the rules of a society that produces, as she calls them, "poor, miserable, marriageable girls.</p><p> Lily's rather violent tumble down the social ladder provides a thumbnail sketch of the general injustices of the upper classes (which, incidentally, Wharton never quite manages to condemn entirely, clearly believing that such life is cruel but without alternative). From her start as a beautiful woman at the height of her powers to her sad finale as a recently fired milliner's assistant addicted to sleeping drugs, Lily Bart is heroic, not least for her final admission of her own role in her downfall. "Once--twice--you gave me the chance to escape from my life and I refused it: refused it because I was a coward," she tells Selden as the book draws to a close. All manner of hideous socialite beasts--some of whose treatment by Wharton, such as the token social-climbing Jew, Simon Rosedale, date the book unfortunately--wander through the novel while Lily plummets. As her tale winds down to nothing more than the remnants of social grace and cold hard cash, it's hard not to agree with Lily's own assessment of herself: "I have tried hard--but life is difficult, and I am a very useless person. I can hardly be said to have an independent existence. I was just a screw or a cog in the great machine I called life, and when I dropped out of it I found I was of no use anywhere else." Nevertheless, it's even harder not to believe that she deserved better, which is why <i>The House of Mirth</i> remains so timely and so vital in spite of its crushing end and its unflattering portrait of what life offers up. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age</h2><p>An in-depth history of the world&#39;s most famous healing shrine traces the dramatic influence of Lourdes on the Catholic Church and its faith, from Bernadette Soubirous&#39;s 1858 visions of the Virgin Mary to his evolution into an important pilgrimage site. 15,000 first printing.</p><p><i>Lourdes</i> by Ruth Harris is a compulsively readable history of the most famous Catholic healing shrine in the world. In 1858, a peasant girl named Bernadette saw the Virgin Mary in a grotto. Millions of pilgrims from around the world have since traveled to Lourdes in order to petition the Virgin for healing. In Harris's hands, the story of Lourdes (up to World War I) is "a story about France, about the struggles of Catholics in the aftermath of revolutionary turmoil, the capacity of the Second Empire to adjust to, and even profit from, religious movements, and the inability of the Third Republic to suppress them." It is also "a focal point in the wider debate between science and religion, and between anti-clericalism and clericalism." If you don't have the historical knowledge to recognize or consider all of the topics identified above, don't worry about it. Harris will give it to you, in language that is as down to earth as it is sophisticated. Her arguments (illustrated by dozens of fascinating photographs) range widely, but through them all she remains attentive to "one fixed point: the essential image of a young, poverty-stricken and sickly girl kneeling in ecstasy in a muddy grotto." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><b>Ruth Harris</b>, Fellow and Tutor in Modern History at New College, Oxford, is the author of <b>Murders and Madness: Medicine, Law, and Society in the Fin de Si�cle</b> and is at work on the nineteenth-century volume of the <b>Penguin History of Modern France</b>.

Her parents, Theodore and Emma Kolyschkine, who belonged to the minor nobility, were devout members of the Orthodox Church and had their child baptized in St. Petersburg on September 15. <p> Schooled abroad because of her father's job, she and her family returned to St. Petersburg in 1910, where she was enrolled in the prestigious Princess Obolensky Academy. In 1912, aged 15, she made what turned out to be a disastrous marriage with her first cousin, Boris de Hueck. At the outbreak of World War I, Catherine became a Red Cross nurse at the front, experiencing the horrors of battle firsthand. On her return to St. Petersburg, she and Boris barely escaped the turmoil of the Russian Revolution with their lives, nearly starving to death as refugees in Finland. Together they made their way to England, where Catherine was received into the Catholic Church on November 27, 1919. </p><p> Emigrating to Canada with Boris, Catherine gave birth to their only child, George, in Toronto in 1921. Soon she and Boris became more and more painfully estranged from one another, as he pursued extramarital affairs. To make ends meet, Catherine took various jobs and eventually became a lecturer, travelling a circuit that took her across North America. Prosperous now, but deeply dissatisfied with a life of material comfort, her marriage in ruins, she began to feel the promptings of a deeper call through a passage that leaped to her eyes every time she opened the Scriptures: "Arise, go... sell all you possess... take up your cross and follow me." Consulting with various priests and the bishop of the diocese, she began her lay apostolate among the poor in Toronto in the early 1930's, calling it Friendship House. </p><p> Because her approach was so different from what was being done at the time, she encountered much persecution and resistance, and Friendship House was forced to close in 1936. Catherine then went to Europe and spent a year investigating Catholic Action. On her return, she was given the chance to revive Friendship House in New York City among the poor in Harlem. After that she was invited to open another Friendship House in Chicago. In 1943, having received an annulment of her first marriage, she married Eddie Doherty, one of America's foremost reporters, who had fallen in love with her while writing a story about her apostolate. </p><p> Meanwhile, serious disagreements had arisen between the staff of Friendship House and its foundress. When these could not be resolved, Catherine and Eddie moved to Combermere, Ontario, Canada on May 17, 1947, naming their new rural apostolate Madonna House. This was to be the seedbed of an apostolate that now numbers more than 200 staff workers and over 125 associate priests, deacons, and bishops, with 22 field-houses throughout the world. Catherine Doherty died on December 14, 1985 in Combermere at the age of 89. Since then, the cause for Catherine's beatification has been officially opened.</p>Dan Herr, publisher of the Critic, once said, Retreats are out... deserts are in! Perhaps I am being presumptuous in thinking that his gentle little arrow was partially directed at me. But I havent noticed too many other people on the North American continent writing about deserts or going to them. <p> For the last few years I have been talking and writing a great deal about silence, solitude, and deserts, and I will continue to write about them because I think they are vitally important to our growing, changing, technological, urban civilization. It is obvious that humanity is facing many problems, will have to face many more, and that these problems are deeply disturbing the souls of all men. It is just as certain that we cannot, must not, reject the new, strange, adventuresome, frightening world that is opening before us, and is already with us. </p><p> Especially we Christians cannot do this, because Christ has inserted himself into this world and we are his people, his body; and so we belong as he does to this world of computers, to this world of cybernetics, that daily brings vaster problems before our minds, hearts and souls. For science moves faster and faster, so much faster than the men of todayor even the men of tomorroware able to apprehend, comprehend or assimilate. </p><p> At the same time, this world of science, together with the spiritual renewal, invites man (the center of creation) to an experience of the liberty of the children of God seldom known before. Now, man can have an encounter with reality and can truly rise to the very sourceto the Origin that has no origin. For the mystery of men in the midst of the world, nature, technology, and urbanization, is intrinsically a Divine Mystery. </p><p> Yet it is still on the cross that God reveals himself to this scientific, technological civilization of ours. As usual, he is both close and distant. As usual, he reveals himself through what is not himself, so that even modern man can recognize the fullness of truththe image of God manifested in the world and its temporality. But it is to be understood that this Mystery, first of all, is not found in the world as such. It is found and seized upon in the hearts of men who seek him, who dont deny his existence. It is because man is fundamentally spiritopen to the absolute of the Divinethat he is always dissatisfied, in one manner or another, with all created reality. Nature is not divine. It is only a sign of God, a cry toward God. </p><p> It seems strange to say, but what can help modern man find the answers to his own mystery and the mystery of him in whose image he is created, is silence and solitudein a word, the desert. Modern man needs these things more than the hermits of old. If we are to witness to Christ in todays marketplaces where there are constant demands on our whole person we need silence. If we are to be always available, not only physically, but by empathy, sympathy, friendship, understanding, and boundless caritas, we need silence. To be able to give joyous, unflagging hospitality, not only of house and food, but of mind, heart, body and soul, we need silence. True silence is the search of man for God. True silence is a suspension bridge that a soul in love with God builds to cross the dark, frightening gullies of its own mind, the strange chasms of temptation, the depthless precipices of its own fears that impede its way to God. </p><p> True silence is the speech of lovers. For only love knows its beauty, completeness, and utter joy. True silence is a garden enclosed, where alone the soul can meet its God. It is a sealed fountain that he alone can unseal to slacken the souls infinite thirst for him. </p><p> True silence is a key to the immense and flaming heart of God. It is the beginning of a divine courtship that will end only in the immense, creative, fruitful, loving silence of final union with the Beloved.</p></p><h2>Archangel</h2><p>Whilst attending a conference on newly-opened Soviet archives, Fluke Kelso is approached by an old NKVD officer who knows where Beria hid Stalin&#39;s private papers. What begins as an academic curiosity turns into a murderous chase across Russia.</p><p><i>Archangel</i> is a remarkably literate novel--and simultaneously a gripping thriller--that explores the lingering presence of Stalin amidst the corruption of modern-day Russia. Robert Harris (whose previous works include <i>Enigma</i> and <i>Fatherland</i>) elevates his tale by choosing a narrator with an outsider's perspective but an insider's knowledge of Soviet history: Fluke Kelso, a middle-aged scholar of Soviet Communism with a special interest in the dark secrets of Joseph Stalin. For years, rumors have circulated about a notebook that the aging dictator kept in his final years. In a chance encounter in Moscow, Kelso meets Papu Rapava, a former NKVD guard who claims that he was at Stalin's deathbed and says that he assisted Politburo member Beria in hiding the black oilskin notebook just as Stalin was passing. Before Kelso can get more details, Rapava disappears, but the scholar is energized by the evidence Rapava has provided. As Kelso begins to pursue his historical prize, however, his investigation ensnares him in a living web of Stalinist terror and murder. It soon becomes clear that the notebook is the key to a doorway hiding many secrets, old and new. <p> Harris's understanding of Soviet and modern Russian is impressive. The novel rests on a seamless blend of fact and fiction that places real figures from Soviet history alongside Kelso and his fictional colleagues. Especially disturbing are the transcripts from interrogations and the excerpt from Kelso's lectures on Stalin; the documents provide chilling evidence to support Kelso's claim: "There can now be no doubt that it is Stalin rather than Hitler who is the most alarming figure of the twentieth century." <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>4 cassettes / 6 hours<br>Read by Anton Lesser<br><br>Present-day Russia is the setting for this stunning new novel from Robert Harris, author of the bestsellers <i>Fatherland</i> and <i>Enigma</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Archangel</b> tells the story of four days in the life of Fluke Kelso, a dissipated, middle-aged former Oxford historian, who is in Moscow to attend a conference on the newly opened Soviet archives.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>One night, Kelso is visited in his hotel room by an old NKVD officer, a former bodyguard of the secret police chief Lavrenty Beria.

Out of the blue, a monastery in India for which she had raised some money contacted Burroughs and asked her to host His Holiness Penor Rinpoche, one of the highest-ranking lamas of Tibetan Buddhism, on his first visit to America. After meeting Burroughs, and observing her and her followers for a period of five days, he told her that she was a "great, great bodhisattva," and already, unbeknownst to her, practicing Buddhism. Later, in India, he officially recognized this Jewish-Italian woman from Brooklyn as the reincarnation of a sixteenth-century Ti-betan saint, making her the first American woman to be named a tulku, or reborn lama. <br><br><i>The Buddha from Brooklyn</i> tells the complex and fascinating story of how Catharine Burroughs, now known as Jetsunma Ahk�n Lhamo, embarked on a journey to build the largest Tibetan Buddhist center in America. With boundless enthusiasm but precious little formal training in Buddhist practices and traditions, Jetsunma and her students bought an estate in Poolesville, Maryland, on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., and founded Kunzang Palyul Choling (Fully Awakened Dharma Continent of Absolute Clear Light). Under Jetsunma's tutelage, the group memorized sacred texts and held all-night prayer vigils. They asked venerable Tibetan lamas to visit and give them "empowerments." Many took Buddhist vows and became monks and nuns. And as word of this remarkable place spread, others came to see the new lama for themselves and joined her community.<br><br>Martha Sherrill, a writer at <i>The Washington Post</i>, heard about Jetsunma in 1993. She visited the center and was charmed by both its charismatic lama, the only Western woman in the male-dominated hierarchy of Tibetan Buddhism, and by the monks and nuns (all Americans) living there. They seemed, for the most part, like a remarkably happy group of people whose lives had been transformed by this exotic, imported faith&#x2014;and by Jetsunma. At the beginning of <i>The Buddha from Brooklyn</i>, as the group is breaking ground for a sacred monument called a stupa, Sherrill commences her own journey to discover for herself what makes this unlikely lama&#x2014;who enjoys clothes shopping and manicures, Motown music and <i>Star Trek</i> reruns&#x2014;such a magnetic spiritual leader. And as the story unfolds, so do the secrets of this seemingly idyllic sanctuary. <br><br>Compassionate and clear-eyed, Sherrill takes her readers on a breathtaking exploration inside the monastery at Poolesville, a place where idealistic but flawed human beings struggle with their devotion every day. She demystifies monastic life and Tibetan Buddhism, and amends the simplified view that most Americans have of this 2,500-year-old faith. Weaving together the stories of the believers into a narrative structure that is as moving and beautiful as the stupa they are building, Sherrill has created a brilliant work of investigative journalism that raises profound, provocative questions about religious faith and its price. <i>The Buddha from Brooklyn</i> is a monument to the miracles and failures that stem from the deepest human longings.</p><p><i>Buddha from Brooklyn</i> begins like the biographies <i>Crooked Cucumber</i> and <i>Cave in the Snow</i>--a venerated Buddhist teacher from humble beginnings is surrounded by respectable Western students. Unlike the seasoned masters Shunryu Suzuki and Tenzin Palmo, however, Jetsumna Ahkon Lhamo, the red-headed woman from Brooklyn who wore a black leather jacket and stick-on nails, had no Buddhist training. And still she had managed to build up the largest monastery of Tibetan Buddhists in America. Martha Sherrill, a journalist for <i>The Washington Post</i>, introduces us to Jetsumna's monastery outside Washington, D.C., and to the world of Tibetan Buddhism. With a measured hand, she unfolds the life of Jetsumna and her acolytes, revealing the unshakable devotion, the enormous sums of cash, the ostracism, and the mysterious magnetism of the highest-ranked woman in Tibetan Buddhism. Jetsumna joined the illustrious ranks of Tibetan lamas after being discovered to be an enlightened reincarnation by the same lama who would later discover Steven Seagal. As Sherrill learns, Jetsumna did appear to be enlightened, and her students believed in her infallibility. They became model Tibetan Buddhists, doing prostrations, building stupas, saving all sentient beings. So why did the group occasionally seem like a cult? In a narrative of complexity and sensitivity, Sherrill struggles with the answers to this and other doubts even while she is attracted to the religion herself but troubled by its embodiment in this stretch of wilderness outside America's capital. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>"Fabulous. In a single volume, Martha Sherrill provides a road map to modern spirituality, highlighting its immense perils while seeing its possibilities. With deep, often profound human understanding, she goes to the heart of American Buddhism, taking the reader on a surprising, literate, and frequently chilling journey.

These are some of the most special creatures of woodland, wild and seashore--ranging from a furry dormouse to a splendid lizard over 4 feet long; from elephant, lion and hippopotamus to garden frog and ladybird; from owl to pussycat to penguin, puffin, crab and seal--all enchantingly playful yet true in proportion and detail, each a personality in its own right. The traditional dolls are equally original--from Pocket Dolly, Queen and Knave of Hearts, and Susan Jane in her period costume--to Jotho the Clown, Captain Hook, and Humpty Dumpty. In addition, every aspect from the simple circle construction that makes Guinea pig, panda, duck and snail to techniques that produce the superb Teddy bear with his jointed limbs, are detailed. Insertion of musical units and voices and the creation of expressive features (eyes, noses, mouths, cheeks and freckles, manes and whiskers) are also demonstrated. CREATIVE SOFT TOY MAKING is destined to give many hours of pleasure to the grown-ups who make the toys (and their own personal variations) as well as to the happy children who will cherish them.</p><p></p><h2>The Klutz Book of Magic</h2><p>Exposes the secrets of scores of tricks from professional magicians and comes complete with a silk scarf and four other props</p><p>Presto!

Louis L'Amour has been best known for his ability to capture the spirit and drama of the authentic American West. Now he guides his readers to an even more distant frontier -- the enthralling lands of the 12th century.<p> At the center of <i>The Walking Drum</i> is Kerbouchard, one of L'Amour's greatest heroes. Warrior, lover, scholar, Kerbouchard is a daring seeker of knowledge and fortune bound on a journey of enormous challenge, danger and revenge. Across the Europe, the Russian steppes and through the Byzantine wonder of Constantinople, gateway to Asia, Kerbouchard is thrust into the heart of the treacheries, passions, violence and dazzling wonders of a magnificent time. From castle to slave gallery, from sword-racked battlefields to a princess's secret chamber, and ultimately, to the impregnable fortress of the Valley of Assassins, <i>The Walking Drum</i> is a powerful adventure of an ancient world you will find every bit as riveting as Louis L'Amour's stories of the American West.</p><b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour</b> is the only novelist in history to receive both the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. He has published ninety novels; twenty-seven short-story collections; two works of nonfiction; a memoir, <i>Education of a Wandering Man</i>; and a volume of poetry, <i>Smoke from This Altar</i>. There are more than 300 million copies of his books in print.</p><h2>The Lover Within: Accessing the Lover in the Male Psyche</h2><p>Shows men how to experience their amorous urges without feeling overwhelmed or emasculated by them</p><p>This last volume of four (The Magician Within, p. 208, etc.) from Jungian psychoanalyst Moore and mythologist Gillette completes a vision of the mature man as a noble, emotionally generous, artistically expressive soul. Here, stating that all men are ``wired for loving, and for mystical experience,'' the authors consider why this is such a difficult ``energy'' for most men to master. They agree with men's movement luminary Robert Bly on the importance of a father to a boy's psychological development and on the connection between impaired adult instincts and early loss or deprivation: ``What determines the mode of a man's loving [monogamy, promiscuity, etc.] involves the ways in which he was wounded and affirmed as a boy.'' Men can struggle to avoid shadow behaviors and learn to use techniques to access the ``Lover within''--techniques including some form of play every day (to honor ``the Child within''); expressive activities (especially dance); and the development of capacities for spiritual experience. In this view of the authentic lover's ideal, a romantic involvement is central, not to find the lost elements or repressed parts of a man's life--though failure to do so sours a relationship--but to share what Harville Hendrix calls a ``passionate friendship'' (a friendship with, the authors add, a spiritual dimension). Shorter and less burdened by elaborate distinctions than the previous books--and offering a more streamlined roundup of background examples and fewer of those murky philosophical passages that erect barriers where there should be bridges. But even so, it's a dense and weighty read. (Fifty b&amp;w photos, eight pages color photos--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In this final volume in the four-book series that began with The King Within , Jungian analyst Moore and mythologist Gillette, a counselor, examine the Lover archetype within the male psyche (the others are the King, the Warrior, and the Magician--each examined in a previous volume). The authors trace how the Lover--the feeling side of men's nature--gives rise to passion, creativity and the pursuit of pleasure. Through the Lover's energy, the conscious mind may encounter the personal and collective unconscious. However, the authors contend, because many men fear being consumed--and thus emasculated--by the Lover's energy, they suppress their feelings and creative instincts. At the opposite extreme, a man can become possessed by the Lover, which then manifests itself as an addictive personality (whether to alcohol, drugs, food or relationships). A potpourri of Jungian theory and mythology, with anecdotes from Moore's workshops and private practice, this book attempts to show men how to get in touch with their inner Lover and use its energies without becoming consumed by them.

The storytellers knew their craft and bewitched listeners would sit and listen long into the night as moths flitted around overhead. The Moth is a non-profit group that is trying to recapture this lost art, helping storytellers - old hands and novices alike - hone their stories before playing to packed crowds at sold-out live events.</p><p>The very best of these stories are collected here: whether it's Bill Clinton's hell-raising press secretary or a leading geneticist with a family secret; a doctor whisked away by nuns to Mother Teresa's bedside or a film director saving her father's Chinatown store from money-grabbing developers; the Sultan of Brunei's concubine or a friend of Hemingway's who accidentally talks himself into a role as a substitute bullfighter, these eccentric, pitch-perfect stories - all, amazingly, true - range from the poignant to the downright hilarious.</p></p><p>The Moth is an acclaimed not-for-profit organization dedicated to the art and craft of storytelling. It is a celebration of both the raconteur, who breathes fire into true tales of ordinary life, and the storytelling novice, who has lived through something extraordinary and yearns to share it. At the center of each performance is, of course, the story and The Moth's directors work with each storyteller to find, shape and present it. The Moth received the MacArthur Award for Creative and Effective Institutions in January 2012. <br><br>Since its launch in 1997, The Moth has presented thousands of stories, told live and without notes, to standing-room-only crowds worldwide. <br><br>Catherine Burns is Artistic Director of The Moth.<br>"Passionate . . . brilliant, and quietly addictive."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The London Guardian</i></i></b><br><br>"[In this book] the stories not only maintain their oral integrity but also take on new dimensions, allowing you to ponder a turn of events or to swirl the language around in your head without missing the next part of the story."&#x2015;<b><i>David Vecsey, NYTimes.com "The 6th Floor" blog</i></b><br><br>"Burns, artistic director of the award-winning The Moth Radio Hour, frees stories whetted for a live audience onto the page, proving the richness of great storytelling: that one can gain as much as a member of an audience communally cringing, laughing and weeping, as a reader privately surrendering to the complicity of human experience."&#x2015;<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>"When I started to read the new collection 'The Moth: 50 True Stories,' [the storytellers'] distinctive voices turned on my audio button.

The family moved often, and Penelope was educated at half a dozen institutions before spending a year at the University of London. In 1937 she married the journalist Charles Dimont, with whom she had two daughters. Two more daughters by two different men would follow before, in 1949, she divorced Dimont and married the barrister, novelist, and playwright John Mortimer, with whom she had another daughter and her only son. The Mortimers were celebrated as &#x201c;the last word in marital chic,&#x201d; but the marriage was tumultuous and the couple divorced in 1972. In addition to <i>The Pumpkin Eater </i>(1962), made&nbsp;into a 1964 film from a screenplay by Harold Pinter and starring&nbsp;Anne Bancroft and Peter Finch, Mortimer published several other&nbsp;novels, including <i>Daddy&#x2019;s Gone A-Hunting</i> (1958),<i> Long Distance</i>&nbsp;(1974), and <i>The Handyman </i>(1983); a travel book co-authored with&nbsp;John Mortimer, <i>With Love and Lizards</i> (1957); and a biography of&nbsp;the Queen Mother. She also served as a film critic for the <i>London&nbsp;Observer</i> and was a regular contributor of short stories to <i>The New&nbsp;Yorker.</i> The first volume of her autobiography <i>About Time</i> (1979)&nbsp;was awarded the Whitbread Prize and was followed by <i>About Time&nbsp;Too</i> (1993).<br><br> Daphne Merkin is the author of <i>Enchantment</i>, a novel and&nbsp;<i>Dreaming of Hitler,</i> a collection of essays.

One of the the many&nbsp;achievements of&nbsp;<i>The Pumpkin Eater</i>&nbsp;is that it somehow&nbsp;manages to find universal truths in what was hardly an&nbsp;archetypal situation: Mortimer peels several layers of skin&nbsp;off the subjects of motherhood, marriage, and monogamy,&nbsp;so that what we&#x2019;re asked to look at is frequently red-raw&nbsp;and painful without being remotely self-dramatizing.

As the great poet William Butler Yeats wrote, "the only two things worth writing about are sex and death," and in <i>Fear of Dying</i>, Jong takes on both. Along the way, she also tells the story of a marriage that grows happier despite all.

Sam Gribley may coexist peacefully with the peregrine falcon Oksi and the small predator he calls the Baron Weasel, but the weasel's attraction to Oksi's young eyases (chicks) puts the two animals at odds. After several clever but failed attempts over the course of weeks, the Baron Weasel does at last reach the high nesting box&#x2014;but before he can seize either of the eyases, his arrival startles them into taking their first flights. Sam, dressed in buckskin, puts in an occasional appearance, but otherwise there's little sign of human presence in San Souci's verdant, open forest landscapes. Without anthropomorphizing, both the author and the illustrator make this nature tale and its animal participants accessible and inviting to young readers.

He is now an author specialising in information books for children. He lives in Cheshire with his wife, a book designer, and their two children.Grade 4-6-At first glance, these profusely illustrated books appear to be a lighthearted approach to some grim chapters in the history of the world. Chapter titles are often blithe and the cartoon art depicts the gory and abominable treatment of one group of people by another. But closer examination of the texts and pictures reveals informative books, packed full of the facts students often seek. The first title describes the life of a woman from the Black Sea area who is kidnapped and taken to serve as a slave in ancient Greece. The treatment of the slaves by the aristocracy is depicted along with descriptions of everyday life. Gladiator highlights the superiority of the Roman army, which returned its prisoners to Rome where they were trained to be arena fighters. Rules of battle and types of gladiators are described. Mention is also made of the simulated sea battles that took place in the flooded arenas and of staged wild-animal hunts. Mummy covers the process of embalming and mummification along with the symbolic features of an Egyptian burial. Discoveries of tombs and modern beliefs about mummies are also included. While these books cover material included in other titles, their approach to history will be extremely popular with students who relish a bit of blood and guts along with their historical facts.<br><i>Elizabeth Stumpf, Clearfield Middle School, PA </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Things That Sometimes Happen: Very Short Stories for Little Listeners</h2><p>Here are a few things that sometimes happen: <br> HAPPY THINGS <br> An unpopular Black Crayon proves to a Little Girl how useful he really is. <br> SAD THINGS <br> On a very hot day, an Ice-Cream Cone waits...and waits...to be eaten. <br> EXCITING THINGS <br> A Papa catches cold, so his Little Boy gets to go to work instead! <br> These nine very short stories for very young readers -- culled from Newbery Honor author Avi's first book and illustrated by Caldecott Honor artist Marjorie Priceman -- ingeniously capture the funny, surprising spirit of a child's imagination.</p><p>Avi is the author of more than seventy books for children and young adults, including the 2003 Newbery medal winner&nbsp;<i>Crispin: The Cross of Lead</i>.

She lives in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.PreSchool-Grade 3-Culled from a longer collection of the same name (Doubleday, 1970; o.p.) and newly illustrated, these nine brief stories combine the whimsical magic of nursery rhymes with the familiarities of everyday life, fashioning a fanciful world that invites young imaginations to soar. The anything-can-happen tone is set in the title piece, in which a boy and his cat meet at lunchtime and compare their morning adventures, which include a visit to the North Pole, a tiger hunt, and an encounter with a bunch of fur-grooming monkeys. In "Small Between the Rain," a youngster shrinks himself down to a size that enables him to run between the raindrops, but he ends up falling into a puddle. In "Going to Work," a boy takes his sick father's place on the job. Told in simple language and packed with child appeal, these tantalizing tales are neatly tied together by Priceman's glorious gouache illustrations. Capricious and colorful, the artwork swirls around the text, providing lots of eye-catching action, intriguing visual surprises, and a needed sense of continuity. With their loose lines, flowing curves, and bright color combinations, the pictures have a childlike quality that matches the tone of wonder that infuses the stories. This is a great choice for sharing aloud, and for inspiring children to describe the things that sometimes happen to them and create their own tales.<br><i>Joy Fleishhacker, formerly at School Library Journal</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Heartsblood: Hunting, Spirituality, and Wildness in America</h2><p>In Heartsblood, nationally acclaimed nature writer and veteran outdoorsman David Petersen takes a clear-eyed look at humans and hunting, and reaches conclusions sure to challenge everyone&#39;s preconceptions. He draws clear distinctions between true hunting and contemporary hunter behavior, praising what&#39;s right about the former and damning what&#39;s wrong with the latter. Along with his extensive personal experience, Petersen draws on philosophy, evolutionary science, biology, and empirical studies to create an engaging and literate work that offers a unique look at hunting, hunters, anti-hunting, and, in the words of the author, &#34;life&#39;s basic truths.&#34;</p><p>Natural-history writer David Petersen's <i>Heartsblood</i> is not so much about hunting, although that controversial subject is an important part of the book, as is a lively, deeply intelligent discussion of what it means to be a human animal aware of what lies outside. Petersen suggests that a true engagement with the natural world requires a keen knowledge of its workings--of how water flows, of how animal populations wax and wane--and a recognition of the realities of life and death.<p> An avid fisherman and hunter, Petersen has little patience with the yahoos who blast at anything in sight, those thoughtless persons who have given hunting a bad name. Neither does he suffer lightly those who maintain that hunting is morally wrong, for, he insists, in the absence of natural predators, hunters act as a necessary brake on overpopulation, which can lead only to suffering. He has little use for expensive gear, for GPS systems and top-of-the-line weapons, nor for most hunting magazines, which, he says, cater to just those yahoos with a taste for fancy goodies, and which he deems "greedy and increasingly immoral."</p><p> With all those peeves and qualifications, it would not be out of place for Petersen to assume a grumpy air. For the most part, however, he does not; he is cordial to those who disagree with his views, which he carefully backs with biological facts, philosophical and anthropological interpretations, and reflections gathered from a half-century's experience in the wild. His book deserves a wide audience, and the ideas within it merit much discussion as thoughtful men and women everywhere do what they can to protect what little is left of nature--a struggle in which hunting, Petersen holds, can play an important part. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Petersen brings an uncommonly broad perspective to this highly personal, passionate and deeply persuasive argument for responsible hunting. He reminds us that humans have been predominantly hunters for 99% of our species' history; by comparison agriculture occupies merely a brief moment in the human timeline and the era of shrink-wrapped supermarket meat even less. Biologically, we were built to hunt, he contends, a reality carved into the human genome as deeply as wildness imprints the genetic makeup of prey. Denying our genetic predisposition makes us less than fully human, he argues, which will undoubtedly strike many as radical. But Petersen is not a polemicist bent on pushing every citizen into hunting. In fact, he calls himself a "fence-straddler," an advocate of animal welfare (which he differentiates from animal rights) who has been criticized by antihunters as "rabidly prohunting" and knocked by hunters' rights advocates as "an anti in hunter's camouflage." Much of Petersen's argument (his delineation of the three different types of hunters, his criticism of holier-than-thou vegetarianism, his disdain of trophy hunting) treads a well-worn path, but this ambivalence lends his conclusions greater credibility. More unique and provocative is his contention that humans, far from evolving beyond the need to kill our own food, instead risk devolving when we avoid facing firsthand the deaths that sustain our survival. Though he goes overboard in strumming the mystical chord and seems at times too fond of inflated language, Petersen's ambitious analysis of this contentious issue is impressively well reasoned.

This collection of nearly three dozen selections from his work at <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and <i>Golf Digest</i> is alternately irreverent and revering, continually insightful, and often hilarious. <p> Both his writing and his thinking are as bold as a six-foot putt uphill: his deep respect for the Ben Hogans, Tommy Bolts, and Byron Nelsons is as palpable as his disgust with the game's corporatization and the self-important foolishness of swing theorists and TV announcers. A fine golfer himself, Jenkins isn't content to just sit on the sidelines opining; "Golf with the Boss" is a luscious romp around the links with President Bush, and "You'll Not Do That Here, Laddie," has him touring, and suffering on, the courses of the game's birthplace in Scotland. </p><p> Years after the fact, his reportage continues to resonate and spin like a crisp drive on a chilly morning. "It was, I still believe, the most remarkable day in golf since Mary Queen of Scots found herself three down to an unbathed bagpiper and invented the back nine... What happened?" he asks in "Whoo-Ha, Arnie!," his dramatic account of the 1960 U.S. Open. "Oh, not much. Just a routine collision of three decades at one historical intersection. On that afternoon, in the span of just 18 holes, we witnessed the arrival of Nicklaus, the coronation of Palmer, and the end of Hogan." To be sure, it was one for the ages, and Jenkins's prose etches it in stone with dead-solid perfection. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>"Tell me about plumbing, fine. Tell me about carpentry, terrace gardening, the timer on VCRs. Go ahead and explain cellophane. Tell me about all of these things, but don't try to tell me about golf, okay? Golf I know."--Dan Jenkins <br>After four decades of covering golf-not to mention "playing scratch from the blues and gambling for my own money when I didn't have any," Dan Jenkins most definitely knows golf. He may, in fact, know the game better than anyone on the planet. Now, his latest and long awaited collection brings together his best writing on the game, from serious pieces on timeless classics like the 1954 Masters and the 1960 Open to humorous takes on everything from the best things in golf-the best bar is Club XIX in the Pebble Beach Lodge-to his unrequited love of golf carts. With a cast that includes everyone from Hogan, Palmer, and Nicklaus to all of the lurkers and spoilers on the PGA Tour, the book is a timeless addition to great golf literature.</p><h2>The Green Book (Sunburst Book)</h2><p>"We are at Shine, on the first day, " says Pattie, when, as the youngest member of the group, she is given the honor of naming the new settlement.

But the success of Shine remains doubtful as crops fail and provisions brought from Earth dwindle.

Wesley Ariarajah believes that authentic Christian faith demands that we rethink central concepts of the Christian theological tradition. Ariarajah&#39;s work is based on the conviction that some of the basic doctrinal formulations about God, Sin, Christ, Salvation, and Mission can in fact be rethought for our day, helping us to affirm deeply the Christian faith while still respecting other religious experiences in their distinctiveness. In this book, Ariarajah traces the biblical roots and theological developments of these doctrines, evaluates their coherence, and recommends new constructive options for a Christian theology of religions in the context of religious plurality.</p><p>&#34;Challenging, provocative, and thoughtful, Your God, My God, Our God is not afraid to confront a vitally important question for today how our increased awareness of religious plurality affects Christian theology itself. Readers may not agree with all of Ariarajahs answers, but they will discover in this exploration a draught of heady new wine which refreshes the spirit and encourages them to carry on with their own theological wrestling.&#34; - Clare Amos, Programme Executive, Interreligious Dialogue and Cooperation, World Council of Churches No one has been better situated by experience and vocation to understand the change in the relation of Christianity and the religions than Wesley Ariarajah. And no one exceeds his generosity of spirit in interpreting the controversies that change arouses. Radical in its scope and humble in its spirit, this book distils the theological counsel of a pioneering thinker. Whether provoked to agreement or to argument, all of us who care for these questions will be the better for hearing the case he makes with the same open heart with which he offers it. - S. Mark Heim, Samuel Abbot Professor of Christian Theology, Andover Newton Theological School In this tightly argued and lucidly written little book, Wesley Ariarajah offers a staunch response to those academics who recently have been calling for a moratorium on the theology of religions. He makes clear that the urgency of engaging followers of other religious traditions provides the opportunity to review, reform, and re-appropriate ones own. In both college classrooms and parish discussion groups, this is a book that will engage and inspire. - Paul F. Knitter, Paul Tillich Professor of Theology, World Religions, and Culture, Union Theological Seminary, New York</p><h2>Grammars of Creation</h2><p>Roaming across topics as diverse as the Hebrew Bible, the history of science and mathematics, the ontology of Heidegger, and the poetry of Paul Celan, Steiner examines how the twentieth century has placed in doubt the rationale and credibility of a future tense - the existence of hope. Acknowledging that technology and science may have replaced art and literature as the driving forces in our culture, Steiner warns that this has not happened without a significant loss. The forces of technology and science alone fail to illuminate inevitable human questions regarding value, faith, and meaning. And yet it is difficult to believe that the story out of Genesis has ended, Steiner observes, and he concludes this volume of reflections with an evocation of the endlessness of beginnings.</p><p>"A fresh, revelatory, golden eagle's eye-view of western literature." -Ruth Padel, Financial Times <p>"One reads Steiner . . . for the many sharp insights and speculations that fill all of his books.

On the other hand, he explored more virgin territory and racked up more first ascents than any other climber--perhaps more than any climber who ever lived.<br><br>Although he came to be honoured far and wide and is one of the few mountaineers to be awarded the Order of Canada, he was a modest man who pursued his passion without fanfare, frequently embarking on gruelling expeditions into unknown territory by himself.

He was charismatic and famously attractive to women, but none were able to compete with his first love and he didn't marry until he was almost fifty. Always a popular lecturer, in his later years he devoted his considerable energies to the cause of environmental education.

He also starts in this work to build his case for the fact that the individual came to be understood in Early Christian History as "James the Righteous" and called by everyone "James the Just"-that same individual known by everyone as as "James the Brother of Jesus"-had very much in common with "the Righteous Teacher" described and alluded to in many Dead Sea Scrolls documents. That is why this book, originally published in the early 1980s, was subtitled "A New Hypothesis of Qumran Origins".</p><p>It was necessary to subject both the archaeology and paleography of Qumran-upon which the so-called "Establishment" or "Consensus of Qumran Scholars' had all based both their theories and chronology to thoroughgoing criticism. This he has done, as only someone who originally studied math and physics, could do, in a meticulously masterful fashion. No one has 'laid a glove' on his analysis since. At the same time and in parallel fashion, he starts to suggest that the 'opponent' of this individual in Early Christian History, Paul, had about the same amount of characteristics with the individual these same Qumran Documents are constantly referring to as "The Spouter of Lying", "the Liar" or "Man of Lying", or "the Scoffer" or Jester" (not someone to be taken seriously)-but, of course, this is not the same individual as "the Wicked Priest" whom prestigious Qumran 'scholars' on the highest level insist upon saddling him with because they saw "the Wicked Priest" and "the Lying Spouter" described in Qumran Documents as the same individual.</p><p>Eisenman lays out here in very clear terms that the two individuals denoted as "the Wicked Priest" and "the Lying Spouter" were two distinct and absolutely separate persons-this again, despite what some 'scholars' attempt to foist on him in order to try to make him look ridiculous . No, on the contrary, in doing so, they only make themselves look ridiculous. Eisenman is very careful here - "the Spouter of Lying" is an internal opponent of "the Righteous Teacher" at Qumran. "He denied the Law in the midst of the whole Congregation"! "The Wicked Priest - certainly no 'Maccabean'/'Hasmonean' - was rather an Establishment and probably Herodian High Priest, meaning, appointed by the "Herodians" and their Roman Overlords.</p></p><p>Robert Eisenman is the author of The New Testament Code: The Cup of the Lord, the Damascus Covenant, and the Blood of Christ (2006), James the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls (1998), The Dead Sea Scrolls and the First Christians (1996), Islamic Law in Palestine and Israel: A History of the Survival of Tanzimat and Shari&#x2019;ah (1978), and co-editor of The Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1989), The Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered (1992), and James the Brother of Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls Volumes I and II (2012).

One of the most successful was Williams, who helped to convert the lamentable Tampa Bay Buccaneer franchise into a winner and then, after a stay in the short-lived U.S. Football League, led the Washington Redskins to a Super Bowl victory in 1988. Newly released by the Redskins at age 35, his gridiron career probably over, Williams, with freelance writer Hunter, here has his say about the game and about racism in football. Whether the prejudice against black quarterbacks exists because owners and coaches believe that blacks are not intelligent enough to play the position, or because managers feel that players will not respond well to black leaders, Williams cannot resolve. His testimony, however, is sure to cause a stir. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.MVP in the 1988 Super Bowl but recently released by the Washington Redskins, Williams, a bitter ex-quarterback, tells the story of a black athlete's satisfactions and disappointments. From a humble, supportive Louisiana family, he developed as a player under famed Grambling coach Eddie Robinson and began his professional career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1978. The death of his first wife, injuries, and the prejudice he found against black quarterbacks dogged his career. His assertion that black athletes, especially quarterbacks, suffer crippling discrimination lifts this above the routine sports bio.

Next comes Wesley&#x2019;s extract of Richard Baxter&#x2019;s Aphorisms of Justification, aimed more at those who shared his evangelical emphasis, invoking this honored moderate Puritan to challenge antinomian conceptions of the doctrine of justification by faith. This is followed by Wesley&#x2019;s abridgement of the Shorter Catechism issued by the Westminster Assembly in his Christian Library, where he affirms broad areas of agreement with this standard of Reformed doctrine&#x2015;while quietly removing items with which he disagreed. The fourth item is Wesley&#x2019;s extended response to the Dissenter John Taylor on the doctrine of original sin, which highlights differences within the broad &#x2018;Arminian&#x2019; camp, with Wesley resisting a drift toward naively optimistic views of human nature that he discerned in Taylor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <br></p><p>Randy L.

They became defined by love triangles, played out against the austere moral climate of Victorian England; they outraged their contemporaries with their loves, jealousies and betrayals, and they stunned society when their complex moral choices led to madness and suicide, or when their permissive experiments ended in addiction and death. The characters are huge and vivid and remain as compelling today as they were in their own time. The influential critic, writer and artist John Ruskin was their father figure and his apostles included the painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti and the designer William Morris. They drew extraordinary women into their circle. In a move intended to raise eyebrows for its social audacity, they recruited the most ravishing models they could find from the gutters of Victorian slums. The saga is brought to life through the vivid letters and diaries kept by the group and the accounts written by their contemporaries. These real-lie stories shed new light on the greatest nineteenth-century British art.</p><p>Franny Moyle has a degree in English and History of Art from St John`s College, Cambridge.

Umber&#39;s other obsession or, perhaps, his deepest regret is that ... he will never be able to know any of &#39;the characters of future novels.&#39; In Hitchcockian terms, that&#39;s the McGuffin and as Kloster tells Umber, &#34;If you&#39;re interested in future novels, we must travel to the libraries of the future.&#34; And that&#39;s where the story becomes both Borgesian and Contesque as Umber asks Kloster what he will need for that to happen and Kloster replies: &#34;We need a library, four mirrors, and a beautiful sunset.&#34; -- Mark Axelrod</p><p>Imagine the contours of an obsession.&nbsp;The distance between Angelina?s lips and the contours of a Laguna Beach sunset is not great. Angelina?s Lips is a story of the main character, Umberto Umber?s, homonymal identity; a story of the search for what is not one?s self.&nbsp;There are many ways to recount such a loss: live through the opportunity of homonymity (the same as anonymity?), or roll to the edges and corners of a continent.&nbsp;Southern California offers just such an opportunity, tucked on the edge of the Pacific (itself a contradiction) and, paradoxically, a terminus of sorts where life finds continuous renewal even if only on celluloid. As Angelina?s Lips unfolds, the character Jamshid Kloster tells the protagonist Umber: ?If you?re interested in future novels, we must travel to the libraries of the future.?&nbsp;The libraries of the future are the memories of the present, memories of travel, visitation, dialogue and observation, all of which accumulate their effect as they are translated beyond our own experiences and languages.&nbsp;The intimacy of a memory travels via its retelling, as Conte has done with his, and as Roberto Buranello has done in his excellent recounting of it in English. -- Pasquale Verdicchio<b>Giuseppe Conte </b>was born in Imperia, Italy and studied at the University of Milan earning a degree in literature in1968.

Well, if it&#39;s a wombat that&#39;s familiar with humans, says author Jackie French, you rub the bony ridge along its back or behind its ears. And the harder you scratch, the better the wombat likes it. For more than thirty years, Jackie French has lived in the Australian bush, coexisting with wild wombats. In this cross between memoir and natural history, Jackie shares her often hilarious adventures with her wombats neighbors and describes their physiology, history, and habits. Bruce Whatley adds pencil drawings in both comic and realistic styles. It&#39;s a book that&#39;s perfect for the budding naturalist. It&#39;s an easy read. It&#39;s full of funny stories.

Original.</p><p><i>99 More Unuseless Japanese Inventions</i> is a delightfully wacky book, easily the equal of its predecessor, 1995's <i>101 Unuseless Japanese Inventions</i>. Those of you fortunate enough to pick that book up (and that's quite a few people--it was a surprise hit) already know that "Chindogu" is the not-so-ancient Japanese art of creating "gadgets that appear to be useful, but on closer examination, aren't." <p> <i>99 More Unuseless Japanese Inventions</i> is written with a droll earnestness that is perfectly in pitch. But what puts the book over the top are the tongue-in-cheek catalog-style photos that show each invention in use. The idea of "The Portable Countryside" is amusing, but when you actually see a stern-faced Japanese executive with a flower box full of greenery swinging at his side like an oversized purse, it's impossible not to laugh. Or consider the definition of "Swiss Army Gloves": "Multi-purpose mittens that keep you ready for anything. Swiss Army Gloves provide a lighter, fork, corkscrew, bottle opener, pen, cutter, hole puncher and two screwdrivers all at the tips of your fingers--literally." </p><p> Chindogu is an exacting art, and the rules for its creation can be found in the front of the book. As a gentle, sly satire of the welter of new and better inventions that constantly pours down on us, <i>99 More Unuseless Japanese Inventions</i> is admirable. That may be assigning much too much sense to this splendidly nonsensical volume; nevertheless, this book and its mate are wonderful.</p>Kenji Kawakami is the inventor of the concept of Chindogu and the founder of the 10,000-member International Chindogu Society.

Yet this essential landscaping element is too often overlooked in smaller yards. <i>Small Patios,</i> the latest book in our Garden Design series, presents a variety of patio projects tailored for small spacesfrom simple resting spots at the side of a path to more elaborate structures paved with tiles and enclosed in vine-covered trellises. Each project is illustrated with color photographs and includes easy-to-follow step-by-step directions. With detailed information on everything from paving, drainage, furniture, and plants, <i>Small Patios</i> is an indispensable guide to turning even the tiniest patch of ground into a peaceful outdoor retreat.</p><p>"A garden that lacks privacy fails as a living space," writes Hazel White, author of this do-it-yourself guide to small patios. Managing editor of the <i>Sunset Western Garden Book</i>, White knows how to turn a swath of untamed land into an outdoor room, and most importantly, she knows how to teach readers to do it. Those who feel daunted by the prospect of bringing in tile or slate and building a floor themselves will feel encouraged after perusing this volume. There's a wide variety of patio "recipes" to choose from here: granite chips in a grass square, an outdoor dining room protected by a rose bower, a lush pondside terrace. In the opening pages White covers essential topics such as drainage, placement, size, and materials. She also muses on the function of the patio in daily life: "you can read the headlines of the morning newspaper in the fresh air while you also read the clouds and the prospect of warmth or rain." <i>Small Patios</i> will appeal to do-it-yourself types who want to pour concrete and move gravel; it will also appeal to dreamers who are thinking of building a patio someday, and simply want to know how it's done. <i>--Emily White</i>Hazel White is a horticultural journalist and editor.

He had many stories and novellas published before embarking on a sequence of full-length novels: Gridlinked, The Skinner, The Line of Polity and Cowl.<b>Brass Man</b><br><b>1</b><i>The lethal results for a human of directly interfacing with an AI have been known since the apotheosis of that being who was, briefly, both Iversus Skaidon and the Craystein Computer. This joining killed Skaidon and sent the Craystein far to the other side of weird, where even other AIs find its communications somewhat</i> ... <i>gnomic. But what is this 'direct interfacing' - surely we do this through our augs and gridlinks? Not so. These two methods of connection, along with planetary servers and so forth, act as buffers between the human and the AI minds. This is necessary because though, in most cases, the human mind is something that an AI could run as a brief sub-program, in some cases it has something that is beyond our silicon saints. Call that something imagination, vision, psychosis</i> ... <i>it is something that is rooted in our primeval psyche and was never anything to do with the pellucid logic with which we created AI. Direct interfacing gives the AI this human madness, and in turn the human acquires the vast processing power of AI. The resultant composite being transcends all its contemporaries. Briefly, huge synergy is achieved, then the human dies - his mind burnt out like a wristcom connected to a tokomac.</i><i>Note: In recent years there has been much speculation about the possibility of interface filters and biotech support systems. This is all fog, and my opinion is that if it really could be done then someone, somewhere, would be doing it.</i><i>- From</i> How It Is <i>by Gordon</i>&nbsp;<br>Standing on the black glass floor of a virtual viewing chamber aboard the <i>Jack Ketch</i>, Cormac took in the scene projected from a holocam a kilometre out from the hull. The ominously namedTheta-class attack ship bore the shape of a cuttlefish bone, but with outriggers on either side holding torpedo-shaped weapons nacelles. It was the dark red of old blood, and smooth as polished stone. A more modern product of the Polity, its controlling AI, named Jack, took no orders from any human captain. Cormac wondered if it could withstand Jain technology subversion any better than had the <i>Occam Razor</i> and its interfaced captain, Tomalon. In such a ship as this, there was no facility for AI burn - for killing its AI - it having been built after the time of extreme paranoia about AIs taking over ... when they had.To one side of the <i>Jack Ketch</i> he observed other Polity ships surrounding, like flies around a healing wound, the reconstructed area of <i>Elysium</i>. Dreyden, the ruler of this Out-Polity community, had fought against allowing them to render assistance, and threatened them with the smelting mirrors of <i>Elysium</i> just as he had used those same mirrors against the attacking <i>Occam Razor</i>. But the damage to the community had been more than it could sustain and, without help, his little empire here would have fallen apart anyway, but with a greater resultant loss of life. Now, after one year of quarantine, all assistance had been rendered, and Dreyden was just a businessman in yet another community subsumed by the Polity.<i>Eight hundred and twenty-three thousand, one hundred and nine</i> ...That was the figure at the last count, though by now it would have risen by a few souls as people continued to die in the hospital ship, or took the easier route of memcording to escape bodies made irreparable by isotope poisoning.<i>My choice.</i>It had been the risk of this, balanced against the slaughter of millions on Masada. There had been a chance that no one would have died here. But they did. His call.<i>Cadmean victory</i> ...Cormac wondered about the name of this ship he had boarded,now that quarantine was over. Perhaps Jack Ketch the hangman was here for him. He now turned his attention to one whom Earth Central Security was allowing to escape the noose.The trispherical <i>Lyric II</i> was only just visible, by the white light of its fusion drive, as it moved away from <i>Elysium</i>. It was unusual for Polity AIs to make such value judgements on the actions of individuals, and normally they applied the law harshly and without favour. John Stanton had been a mercenary killer, in the past working for the Separatist Arian Pelter, and perhaps deserved to die, as had Pelter. Cormac winced at the memories: Pelter's brass killing-machine, Mr Crane, coming for him; the Golem Cento and Aiden bringing Crane down; and his own subsequent pursuit of Pelter, and killing of the man. Even so, the Earth Central AI had decided, that for what Stanton had since done and risked, no one would be looking when he and his wife Jarvellis returned to their ship and headed away. Cormac observed white fusion flames blink out inside a distortion that seemed to pull at his eyeballs, and knew that the ship had now entered underspace and was gone. He envied John Stanton such freedom - from prosecution, and from responsibility.'A satisfactory conclusion,' said a breathy voice beside his ear.'Cut visual feed,' said Cormac and, as the external image blinked out to reveal the glass-walled projection chamber he stood in, he turned to the ancient Japanese man standing beside him. 'This must be a new definition of "satisfactory" of which I have been unaware. Would you like to elaborate?'Horace Blegg kept his expression bland as he replied, 'Masada and this place are under the control of the Polity, and Skellor now so much interstellar ash.''And here, and at Masada, nearly a million dead,' Cormac added.'Such loss of life is unfortunate, but base your calculation on lives saved, not lives destroyed. Had you and John Stanton not ledSkellor here to be incinerated, he would have killed every human being in the Masadan system, and for him that would have been just the start.'Cormac smiled tiredly. 'I'm not an infant; I made that calculation at the time. But you forget, I've been in <i>Elysium</i> for a year and seen what happened.''My assessment still stands. What is there for you to regret?''My original assessment of Skellor, I would say.''You did not know he had gained possession of Jain technology.''But when I did know, I assumed that, like any Separatist upon encountering Earth Central Security, he would go scuttling for cover. I didn't register how quickly he disappeared after our first encounter, and I didn't make the connection between that disappearance and his work with chameleonware.''Hindsight can be brilliantly incisive, and never misses the banana skins of existence. Do you want to be punished?''No ... what I want is to go back to Masada and find out who is alive and who is dead. I want to retrieve my Shuriken, and see what Mika has to say about the dracomen there - and find out what the EC decision on them is. But, most of all, I want to know how the fuck you got on board this ship. There was no one here last time I looked, and nothing has docked since then.''You well know I don't answer such questions.' Earth Central's leading and most mysterious agent liked to remain inscrutable.'You did it on the <i>Occam Razor</i>, and I at first thought you a projection. I touched you and you remained solid, though something happened to you when the <i>Occam</i> went into U-space. But then, is my memory of events true - because you've screwed with my mind before.''Your memories are true.'Cormac nodded contemplatively. 'I think I know what you are, Blegg. I think I've finally figured it out. You're an avatar of the Earth Central AI - the human face, or interface, which transfers itsorders to its agents. Sometimes you're a projection, sometimes Golem.' He looked directly at Blegg. 'All that bullshit about Hiroshima is precisely that: bullshit.'Blegg grinned. 'If only things were so simple. You are perhaps eighty years old in personal time, Ian Cormac, but with a mind possessing the plasticity of youth and a brain constantly replacing its dying nerve cells, and your apprehension of the world is at the foot of an exponential curve. Immortality is possible for all of humankind now, and many humans will discover what it means to keep on learning and keep on understanding, though many more will simply stagnate. I myself am many centuries ahead of the race as a whole.''Which still doesn't explain how you manage to keep popping up like the Cheshire cat.''Abilities can be acquired, given the time. This is something you will come to understand, as you are one of those who will definitely not stagnate.''What abilities had you already acquired that enabled you to survive the blast from an ancient fission weapon at Hiroshima? You were supposedly a child then.''Maybe I didn't survive it.'Cormac could now feel something, the edge of something he strove to understand, and he knew that Blegg was slipping away from him. With some sense he had never known before, he reached out for the man and found himself groping after shadows.Quite calmly he said, 'You're an avatar, Blegg - I know it.'<i>I am the future</i> ...The projection room now contained only Cormac. He sighed and shook his head. One day he would know precisely everything there was to know about Blegg, but that day was not yet close. With cold precision, he compartmentalized speculation. Now Earth Central Security - ECS - had work for him. There was always such work.<i>When are we heading into U-space?</i> he asked the <i>Jack Ketch</i> AI.'There is a hold on all transport at present, but when we are ready to go I will inform you,' the AI replied.It was only as he was leaving the projection chamber that Cormac realized he had just used his gridlink - hardware inside his skull that had enabled him a near-direct interface with AI - to communicate, which was impossible. It had been deactivated long ago.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Theory and Practice of Virtue, The (Revisions: A Series of Books on Ethics)</h2><p>Many students of philosophical and theological ethics have recently experienced a renewed interest in what may be called an ethic of virtue. Such an ethic focuses less on the concept of duty&#x2015;or doing&#x2015;and more on being. Central to an ethic of virtue is a division of moral life that emphasizes character and character development or moral education. <i>The Theory and Practice of Virtue</i> presents a series of connected essays&#x2015;drawing on the thoughts of such diverse figures as Josef Pieper, Plato Lawrence Kohlberg, and Martin Luther&#x2015;which explore theories of virtue and the practical task of being virtuous. Meilaender follows his consideration of the conceptual difficulties of moral education with a discussion of the practical problems and dangers of attempting to teach virtue, and more generally, of the problems of observing an ethic which emphasizes virtue within a theology that emphasizes grace. Chapters devoted to particular virtues and vices&#x2015;the vice of curiosity and the virtue of gratitude&#x2015;explicitly illustrate the book's central thematic concerns.</p><p>Gilbert Meilaender holds the Phyllis and Richard Duesenberg Chair in Christian Ethics at Valparaiso University, Indiana.[This] is a study in which Christian moral tradition, classical philosophical insights, and contemporary intellectual concerns are blended into a coherent whole. . . . In my judgment the best single chapter in the book is the first: &#39;Thinking about virtue.&#39; For persons unfamiliar with the virtue perspective on ethics this is a lucid and persuasive exploration of the role of virtue in conceiving what morality is all about. It would be particularly useful in a beginning class on religious ethics.&#34; (Journal of Religious Ethics)</p><h2>Tolstoy&#39;s major fiction</h2><p>"Edward Wasiolek, after much valuable work on Dostoevsky, has now written one of the best books on Tolstoy in recent decades. This may be in part because of his preoccupation with Tolstoy's most challenging contemporary, and the resulting sense of their unlikeness in a common pursuit. But there are other, unspeculative reasons. Few studies of Tolstoy have been so carefully pondered and so firmly organized to convince; and not so many show the flexibility and variety of its approach. Wasiolek proposes an essentially simple and consistent reading, but he advances it with subtlety and discretion."&#x2014;Henry Gifford, <i>Times Literary Supplement<br></i></p><p><b>Edward Wasiolek</b> is Avalon Foundation Distinguished Service Professor of Slavic and Comparative Literature and chairman of the Committee on Comparative Studies in Literature at the University of Chicago.

Ambitious ideas about extra dimensions, exotic particles, multiple universes, and strings have captured the public&#x2019;s imagination -- and the imagination of experts. But these ideas have not been tested experimentally, and some, like string theory, seem to offer no possibility of being tested. Yet these speculations dominate the field, attracting the best talent and much of the funding and creating a climate in which emerging physicists are often penalized for pursuing other avenues. As Smolin points out, the situation threatens to impede the very progress of science. With clarity, passion, and authority, Smolin offers an unblinking assessment of the troubles that face modern physics -- and an encouraging view of where the search for the next big idea may lead.</p><p>Lee Smolin earned his Ph.D. in physics at Harvard, then went on to teach at Yale and Pennsylvania State before helping to found the innovative Perimeter Institute. He is the author of The Life of the Cosmos and Three Roads to Quantum Gravity.String theory&#x2014;the hot topic in physics for the past 20 years&#x2014;is a dead-end, says Smolin, one of the founders of Canada's Perimeter Institute of Theoretical Physics and himself a lapsed string theorist. In fact, he (and others) argue convincingly, string theory isn't even a fully formed theory&#x2014;it's just a "conjecture." As Smolin reminds his readers, string theorists haven't been able to prove any of their exotic ideas, and he says there isn't much chance that they will in the foreseeable future. The discovery of "dark energy," which seems to be pushing the universe apart faster and faster, isn't explained by string theory and is proving troublesome for that theory's advocates. Smolin (<i>The Life of the Cosmos</i>) believes that physicists are making the mistake of searching for a theory that is "beautiful" and "elegant" instead of one that's actually backed up by experiments. He encourages physicists to investigate new alternatives and highlights several young physicists whose work he finds promising. This isn't easy reading, but it will appeal to dedicated science buffs interested in where physics may be headed in the next decade. 30 b&amp;w illus. <i>(Sept. 19)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Mary Beth Cooper has said that, if need be, she&#39;ll give her life to see him become a Christian. But will she have to prove it? Thousands of devoted Lacy readers will find out in this eighth installment of the Hannah of Fort Bridger series, which continues the saga of a widowed frontier woman&#39;s faith-filled journey through the hardships and joys of life.</p><p>Al Lacy has written more than ninety novels, including the Angel of Mercy, Battles of Destiny, and Journeys of the Stranger series. He and his wife, JoAnna Lacy, are coauthors of the Mail Order Bride, Hannah of Fort Bridger, and Shadow of Liberty series. The Lacys make their home in the Colorado Rockies.</p><h2>Pocket Canons : Books of the Bible</h2><p>The publication of the King James version of the Bible, translated between 1603 and 1611, coincided with an extraordinary flowering of English literature and is universally acknowledged as the greatest influence on English-language literature in history. Now, world-class literary writers introduce the books of the King James Bible in a series of beautifully designed, small-format volumes. The introducers&#39; passionate, provocative, and personal engagements with the spirituality and the language of the text -- Louis de Bernieres on Job, Charles Johnson on Proverbs, Doris Lessing on Ecclesiastes, David Grossman on Exodus -- make the Bible come alive as a stunning work of literature and remind us of its overwhelming contemporary relevance. It is a publishing project that has ignited interest around the world and, upon its U.K. publication, The Guardian proclaimed it &#34;brilliantly simple ... the Pocket Canons have excited both the literary and the religious worlds.&#34;</p><p>Each of these 12 Pocket Canons comes with its own stunning black and white cover photo, and each has an introduction by a highly qualified writer. For example, author Charles Johnson introduces <i>Proverbs</i>: "Put simply, <i>Proverbs</i> is that richly detailed, many-splendored map. A timeless wake-up call," writes Johnson, who was raised in a Midwestern African Methodist church but later became a Buddhist. "More importantly ... it is a two-millennium-old blue-print for the staggering challenge of living a truly civilized life." Other writers in the series include Doris Lessing ("Ecclesiastes"), Fay Weldon ("Corinthians"), Kathleen Norris ("Revelation"), Thomas Cahill ("Luke"), and Louis de Berni�res ("The Book of Job"). The lilting language of the authorized King James version (translated between 1603 and 1611) is one of the most eloquent English interpretations, written when language was considered high art. Because of the compelling language, the contemporary introductions, and the artsy photography, this collection actually comes off as hip. Yet it never once falters into glitz or superficiality. This is an excellent gift box collection, especially for open-minded scholars. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><h2>Superman/Wonder Woman Vol. 4: Dark Truth</h2><p>Superman, deprived of most of his power and outed to the world as mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent, is in trouble.

The authors tell the parallel stories of a profoundly troubled city--abandoned by the auto industry that had nourished it and becoming for a time the nation's notorious murder capitol--and of the extraordinary man who governed it for 20 years (ill and out-of- favor at age 75, Young chose not to run in the last election). Young grew up in Detroit's Black Bottom neighborhood when it was still a cozy place to live. Tricked out of college because--he says--of his race, he worked at Ford, learned Marxism at the local barbershop, served with the famous Tuskegee Airmen, and immersed himself in left-leaning union activities. He became a local hero after taking on Joe McCarthy's HUAC and, in 1973, was elected mayor when Detroit's racial balance tipped toward African-Americans. In office, Young delivered on many of his promises--most significantly, to divide power through affirmative action where he was empowered to do so, and to tame the police department, whose union newspaper was, he says, still calling blacks ``jungle bunnies'' when he moved into the mayor's waterfront mansion. Here, Young and Wheeler go on to take us through the agonies of grappling with what Young calls ``the damnestdest demographics in America.'' Later on, the former mayor presents a fairly strong case for the imposition of term limits: The man, it seems, was simply overly merged with his city. Since much of the material here on Detroit will be familiar to readers of Ze'ev Chafet's Devil's Night (1990), it's a pity that Young, on his own turf, hasn't told us more about his turbulent relationship with Jesse Jackson, or hasn't been less roguish and elliptical about his personal life. Which is to say that this aptly titled book, while dandy, could have been softer. (Eight pages of b&amp;w photographs) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In his inimitably vinegary colloquial style, Young, the five-term mayor of Detroit, reflects on his eventful life and forthrightly defends his controversial stewardship of America's blackest city. Writing with Wheeler (coauthor of I Had a Hammer ), he recalls his boyhood in Detroit's overcrowded, hustling black east side, his battle against racism in the Army, his rise in the union movement and his vigorous resistance against the House Un-American Activities Committee. He blames the postwar decline of Detroit on misguided federal industrial policy, superhighway construction, blockbusting and white racism. After a scarring 1967 race riot, Young, a state legislator, was elected mayor in 1972 on a platform calling for a "people's police department." Describing Detroit as a "condensed, microcosmic, accelerated version of Everycity, U.S.A.," he convincingly presents himself as a pragmatic radical whose primary concern is the high unemployment rate in his city, and he maintains that his prideful black rhetoric does not obscure his longtime call for racial unity. He argues that Detroit must reconnect with its suburbs, and if his claim that black-governed Detroit has achieved "a level of autonomy . . . no other city can match" sounds self-serving, this still remains a valuable book on urban issues. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Grove (Guardians of Destiny)</h2><p>THE NEW GUARDIANS OF DESTINY NOVEL<br><br><i>Calm the magics caught in thrall:<br>Put your faith in strangers&#x2019; pleas,<br>Watcher, Witch, and treasure trove;<br>Ride the wave to calm the trees,<br>Servant saves the sacred grove. </i><br><br>At the behest of their leader, the Witches of Darkhana are mobilized.

Then his eye was caught by a photograph of the fabled Bent's Fort, one of the original trading posts in Colorado. His family home became an adobe-brick replica of Bent's Fort, which then became The Fort, an extraordinary restaurant whose fame has spread far beyond the wide borders of the West even as the city of Denver has expanded toward Arnold's once-rural locale.</p><p><i>The Fort Cookbook: New Foods of the Old West from the Famous Denver Restaurant</i> chronicles the life of this singular eatery by presenting recipes from its earliest days and throughout its near-forty-year history. There are the unforgettable favorites that helped make The Fort beloved, such as White Cheese Shrimp Enchiladas and Rocky Mountain Oysters, as well as new spins on Old West classics, such as Gonzales Steak stuffed with green chiles and Buffalo Burgers, not to mention enough fabulous steak recipes to make a beef lover swoon. Arnold's inventive cuisine ranges from unfamiliar recipes for increasingly available ostrich and elk to such southwestern comfort food as Blue Corn Blueberry Muffins, Lakota Indian Fry Bread, and Chocolate Chile Cake.</p><p>Peppered with Arnold's exuberant notes on the history of the Old West and wisdom about food and ingredients, <i>The Fort Cookbook</i> is the result of Arnold's genuine curiosity and hands-on experience. Like the colorful Western characters that people his pages, Sam Arnold-author, raconteur, historian, and keeper of The Fort-is a larger-than-life figure with a generous, twofisted approach to hospitality. For armchair travelers recipe lovers, diners, and cooks, there could be no better scout.</p></p><p>Mix a little theme-park flavor with a taste for the history of the Old West, add a hearty appetite and the yen to cook, and you might come close to The Fort--after 40 years of business, more a Denver institution than a restaurant. It was Samuel P. Arnold who first built his home as a replica of Fort Bent, a Colorado fur-trading post, circa 1840. And it was Sam Arnold who invited the public to share his enthusiasm for a time long gone but not forgotten. <i>The Fort Cookbook</i> tells the whole amazing story, dishing up some of the restaurant's more memorable recipes. The meat recipes (elk, venison, buffalo, lamb, and loads of beef) are alone worth the purchase price, but don't think for a minute that Arnold focuses on historic relics that taste as though they might best be left in a museum. He's a man with a modern palate, an eye on Southwestern cuisine as it has developed over the last 20 years, and the good sense to take any and all modern ingredients into account.Have a hankering for buffalo meat? How about some Rocky Mountain oysters? For gourmets hungry for a taste of the Old West, these dishes and more can be found at The Fort, a popular restaurant near Denver that draws more than 100,000 guests per year. <p> <i>The Fort Cookbook</i> allows readers to savor the ambiance of this remarkable restaurant while enjoying the flavor of its celebrated fare. Here are recipes for such dishes as Hot Sausage Bean Dip, Battered and Fried Jalapeos with Cheese (a.k.a. Scorpions), Braised Buffalo Tongue with Caper Sauce, Chicken Adobe, Quail en Quinoa, Santa Fe Pork Chops and more. <i>The Fort Cookbook</i> also includes tempting desserts, breads and even drinks such as George Washington's 1786 Chatham Artillery Punch. Illustrations and stories from the old frontier days and atmospheric sidebars ("How to Teach a Bear to Drink") are peppered throughout, making it the perfect addition to cookbook libraries both east and west of the Rockies.</p></p><h2>Plastic Culture: How Japanese Toys Conquered the World</h2><p>Plastic toys based on Japanese comics, movies and TV shows from <em>Astro Boy</em>, <em>Godzilla</em> and <em>Gatchaman</em>, to <em>Power Rangers</em>, <em>Sailor Moon</em> and <em>Pokemon</em>, have had a powerful effect on the imaginations and the markets of the West, and have kick-started trends in design and pop culture that have crossed from Japan to the West and back East again.<br><br>Lavish full-color photographs of cult, limited-edition, and "designer" toys take us through the postwar period and right up into the present, with a fascinating look at the current vogue for "urban vinyl" and "art" toys.

Those familiar with Appalachian folklore will know the story of Wicked Jack, who accidentally does a nice turn for St. Peter and is given three wishes. Of course Jack, "...meaner than a rattlesnake," comes up with the "...sorriest wishes" St. Peter has ever heard. Jack ends up being rejected at the gates of Hell by the devil himself, which accounts for those mysterious lights in the swamp at night. Wooldridge's rhythmic phrases and colorful expressions read aloud particularly well. Hers is an assured voice, using a sly understatement that provides a terrific backdrop for the pictures done in graphite on paper with oil, oil pastels, "...and a smudge of the coal left over from the illustrator's jack-o'-lantern." Children will especially love the slapstick humor: the text reads, "After that, Jack got meaner than ever," and the pictures show him dropping hot coals down a neighbor's pants, then hoisting him up and shooting him with a slingshot. And Jack himself is priceless, a lumbering oaf with a massive body and ridiculously delicate little feet. Hillenbrand can create figures that will provoke a laugh just by being there. All in all, a book with surefire child appeal.?Lauralyn Persson, Wilmette Public Library, IL<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Frida Kahlo: Face to Face</h2><p>At once deeply personal and brilliantly perceptive, this dynamic reconsideration of the life and work of Frida Kahlo is curated by the prominent feminist artist Judy Chicago, who helped introduce American audiences to Kahlo&#39;s paintings. For decades Judy Chicago has worked tirelessly to ensure that women&#39;s artistic achievements become a permanent part of our cultural heritage. In this sumptuous, large format book, she turns her attention to the work of Frida Kahlo, one of the world&#39;s most revered female painters. In this volume Chicago, together with her collaborator, art historian Frances Borzello, has handpicked a selection of Kahlo&#39;s work, a hundred portraits that speak to the full spectrum of women&#39;s experience. The result is a fascinating conversation between two artistic icons, one that is further enhanced by a dialogue between Chicago and Borzello, an authority on women&#39;s portraiture. The book features each work on its own spread, facing commentary by Chicago and Borzello. Essays explore Kahlo&#39;s many facets: woman, artist, historical figure, and inspiration.

An avid writer and reader, Teresa has been making up stories and poems since she was in grade school. &#34;&#39;To me it was as natural as breathing,&#34;&#39; says Teresa. In high school Teresa would drive her teachers crazy by &#39;creatively&#39; completing assignments. She always met the letter of their assignment, if not the spirit. She worked hard to inject some humor into her work, knowing that the teachers would be reading hundreds of papers and wanting her to stand out. It worked. Teresa took English classes for fun in college and when she applied for a Washington State Teaching credential, the state looked at her transcripts and added an endorsement to teach English through the 12th grade! Teresa cites her teacher Donnell Hunter at Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho, as having a big influence on her and her writing. He published a class magazine to which the class submitted their work under pen names. Their grades depended on how many stories were included in the magazine. Teresa submitted under about 15 different pen names--just to be annoying! But she knew her work was being judged on its merits alone. Mr. Hunter encouraged her journal writing and instilled in Teresa good writing habits that she continues to this day. Teresa served an 18-month mission for her church in Argentina, and taught school for a year in Honduras. She also taught school briefly in St. Mary&#39;s, Alaska -- a little bush village with a population of 500 in the winter and 50 in the summer. She currently is the librarian at Brigadoon Elementary School in Tacoma, Washington. Teresa writes every single day. Without fail. She also works full-time, so that means some days she doesn&#39;t write much, but she always writes. When at home, Teresa&#39;s special spot for writing has a good view of the lilac bushes outside. The wallpaper on her computer is of a winding path through gentle rolling hills and meadows. She tells herself, when stuck for an idea, that the story lies at the end of that path. Teresa also writes when she&#39;s away from home and she carries a laptop computer with her. On family vacation to the Oregon coast she balances her E-mate on her knees and sits out on the deck as seagulls wheel and cry overhead and the ocean waves pound to the shore at the bottom of the cliff. Teresa lives in Tacoma, Washington.Bateman (Leprechaun Gold) and Brewster (Bear and Mrs. Duck) have created a smoothly paced, engaging story of a kindly fisherman and the baby mermaid whom he finds among the fish in his net. While Tarron does backbreaking work on the boat of his greedy brother, Josh, he dreams of the day he might buy his own ship and sail away on exotic adventures. Fishing in treacherous waters, the brothers hear the strains of a mermaid's dangerous song as she attempts to lure them to certain destruction. Tarron covers his ears and steers their ship away from the rocky island but, once safe, Josh rebukes him for not capturing the mermaid and, thus, ensuring their fortune. Later, when the merbaby appears in their net, the brothers make plans to sell her for exhibition. Tarron comes to realize that he "could no more take this merchild onto land than he could throw a human child into the sea." While Josh sleeps, Tarron begins the dangerous journey back to the mermaid. Brewster's full-spread, finely detailed artwork features windblown characters and boats set starkly against washes of pale green, blue and dark aqua, a worthy backdrop for this mythical tale. Ages 4-8. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Chosen for Greatness: How Adoption Changes the World</h2><p>The history of adoption is the history of the world itself.

In Harlequin, Thomas of Hookton travelled to France as an archer and there discovered a shadowy destiny, which linked him to a family of heretical French lords who sought Christendom&#39;s greatest relic. Having survived the battle of Crecy, Thomas is sent back to England, charged with finding the Holy Grail. But Thomas is an archer and when a chance comes to fight against an army invading northern England he jumps at it. Plunged into the carnage of Neville&#39;s Cross, he is oblivious to other enemies who want to destroy him. He discovers too late that he is not the only person pursuing the grail, and that his rivals will do anything to thwart him. After hunting and wounding him, Thomas&#39;s enemies turn him into a fugitive. Fleeing England, he travels to Normandy, determined to rescue Will Skeat, his old commander from Harlequin. Finally Thomas leads his enemies back to Brittany, where he goes to discover an old love and where his pursuers at last trap their reluctant pilgrim. Vagabond is a vivid and realistic portrait of England at a time when the archer was king of Europe&#39;s battlefields.</p><p><i>Vagabond</i>, the second entry in Bernard Cornwell's Grail Quest series, has been eagerly anticipated by those who read the first book, and it doesn't disappoint. Thomas has managed to survive the battle of Cr�cy. Still nursing his wounds, he is dispatched by the king on a mission to look into the matter of his father's inheritance, which is obscurely connected to the Holy Grail. This most precious relic of the Christian faith is a much sought-after object, offering the power of total victory in war to its owner. But Thomas finds himself in the middle of a battle against an army invading the North of England, and other shadowy forces pursuing the grail are prepared to slaughter anyone who stands in their way. In the ruins of his birthplace, Thomas discovers more about his father, and a dangerous voyage to France brings him up against his cousin and arch-enemy, Count of Astarc Guy Vexville. The stage is set for a merciless showdown.<p> Thomas is a protagonist drawn quite as pithily as his much-loved predecessor, and the sheer verve of Cornwell's storytelling here is irresistible. We are plunged into a distant age: bloody, colourful and dangerous.

England's army is fighting in France, and the Scots are invading from the North. Thomas of Hookton, sent back to England to follow an ancient trail to the Holy Grail, becomes embroiled in the fighting at Durham. Here he meets a new and sinister enemy, a Dominican Inquisitor, who, like all of Europe, is searching for Christendom's most holy relic. It is not certain the grail even exists, but no one wants to let it fall into someone else's hands. And though Thomas may have an advantage in the search -- an old notebook left to him by his father seems to offer clues to the whereabouts of the relic -- his rivals, inspired by a fanatical religious fervor, have their own ways: the torture chamber of the Inquisition. Barely alive, Thomas is able to escape their clutches, but fate win not let him rest. He is thrust into one of the bloodiest fights of the Hundred Years' War, the Battle of La Roche-Derrien, and amid the flames, arrows, and butchery of that night, he faces his enemies once again.</p></p><h2>To Ruin A Queen: An Ursula Blanchard Mystery at Queen Elizabeth I&#39;s Court</h2><p>When Elizabethan &#34;secret agent&#34; Ursula Blanchard is re-united with her husband, she learns that her daughter has disappeared and investigates, uncovering a sinister plot to dethrone her queen in the process.

Instead, there was a fire in the hearth, piled too high and giving off a sickly perfume from the herbs which my woman, Fran Dale, had thrown onto it in an effort to please me by sweetening the atmosphere. </p><p> The lying-in chamber was pervaded too by a continual murmur of prayers from Matthew's uncle Armand, who was a priest and lived in the ch�teau as its chaplain. It was he who had married us, three and a half years ago, in England. To my fevered mind, the drone of his elderly voice sounded like a prayer for the dying. Possibly, it was. Madame Montaigle had fetched him after using pepper to make me sneeze in the hope that it would shoot the child out, and then attempting in vain to pull him out of me by hand, which had caused me to scream wildly. She told me afterward that she had despaired of my life. </p><p> Madame Montaigle was my husband's former housekeeper. She had been living in a retirement cottage but she had skill as a midwife and Matthew had fetched her back to the ch�teau to help me. I wished he hadn't for she didn't like me. To her, I was Matthew's heretic wife, the stranger from England, who had let him down in the past and would probably let him down again if given the ghost of a chance. I did not think she would care if I died. I would have felt the same in her place, but I could have done without either Madame Montaigle or Uncle Armand as I lay sweating and cursing and crying, growing more exhausted and feverish with every passing hour, fighting to bring forth Matthew's child, and failing. </p><p> During the second day, I drifted toward delirium. Matthew had gone to fetch the physician from the village below the ch�teau but I kept on forgetting this and asking for him. When at last I heard his voice at the door, telling the physician that this was the room and for the love of God, man, do what you can, it pulled me back into the real world. I cried Matthew's name and stretched out my hand. </p><p> But Madame Montaigle barred his way, exclaiming in outraged tones that he could not enter, that this was women's business except for priest and doctor, and instead of pushing past her as I wanted him to do, he merely called to me that he had brought help and that he was praying to God that all would soon be well. It was the physician, not Matthew, who came to my side. </p><p> The physician was out of breath, for he was a plump man and Matthew had no doubt propelled him up the tower steps at speed. "I agree," he puffed to Dale and Madame Montaigle, "that this is rightly women's business. It is not my custom to attend lying-in chambers. However, for you, seigneur," he added over his shoulder, addressing Matthew and changing to a note of respect, "I will do what I can." He turned back to my attendants. "What has been done already?" </p><p> Madame Montaigle explained, about the pepper and her own manual efforts. Dale spoke little French and her principal task was to lave my forehead with cool water, smooth my straggling hair back from my perspiring face, and offer me milk and broth. The shutters made the room dim and the physician asked for more lights. I heard Matthew shouting for lamps. When they were brought, the physician, without speaking to me, went to the foot of the bed and began doing something to me; I couldn't tell exactly what. I only knew that the pain I was in grew suddenly worse and I twisted, struggling. The physician drew back. </p><p> "The child is lying wrong and it is growing weak. Seigneur..." </p><p> Matthew must still have been hovering just outside the room, for the physician was speaking to him from the end of my bed. He moved away to the door to finish what he was saying out of my hearing, and I heard my husband answer though I could not hear the words that either of them said. I called Matthew's name again but still he wouldn't defy convention and enter. I was left forlorn, bereft of any anchor to the world. I was dying. I knew it now. Here in this shadowed, stinking room, tangled up in sweaty sheets and with Uncle Armand practically reciting the burial service over me; before I was thirty years old; I was going to slip out of the world into eternity. </p><p> "I don't want to die!" I screamed. "Matthew, I don't want to die! I want to see Meg again!" </p><p> My daughter, Meg, was in England. I hadn't seen her for two years and this summer, she would be nine. Now, a vision of her, as vivid as though she were actually there, filled my overheated mind. I saw her, playing with a ball on the grass outside Thamesbank House, where she lived with her foster parents. Her dark hair was escaping from its cap, and her little square face, so like the face of her father, Gerald, my first husband, was rosy with exercise. I could see the gracious outlines of the house, and the ripple of the Thames flowing past. For a moment, it was all so real that I called her name aloud, but the vision faded. She receded from me and was gone. </p><p> "If I die now I'll never see Meg again and I'll never see England again!" I wailed. "Somebody help me!" </p><p> "Hush." Dale was in tears. "Don't waste your strength, ma'am. Take a little warm milk." </p><p> "I don't want milk!" I flung out an arm in a frantic gesture of rejection and sent the cup flying out of Dale's hand, spilling the milk on the trampled rushes and also on Uncle Armand. "I want to give birth and get this over and I wish I'd never married again!" </p><p> Uncle Armand, brushing white spatters from his black clerical gown, said reprovingly: "Hush, madame. All things are according to the will of God. Women who die in childbirth may, I think, receive martyrs' crowns in heaven." </p><p> "I don't want to be a bloody martyr!" I shouted at him. "I want to live!" </p><p> Peering through the lamplight and the red fog of my pain and fever, I saw the physician and Matthew anxiously conferring in the doorway. The fever seemed to have sharpened my senses for although the physician's voice was still pitched low, this time I heard what he was saying. </p><p> "It is a son, seigneur, but there is little chance of saving him, I fear, and if I try, we shall almost certainly lose the mother. If we try instead to save her, the chance of success is better, but it will surely mean the child's death. I cannot hope to save them both; that much is sure. It is for you to decide." </p><p> I cried out, begging for my life. I had wanted Matthew's child but in that moment it ceased to be real to me. Nothing was real except the threat, the terrible threat of extinction. Everything became confused. As delirium finally took over, I saw the physician come back to me but after that I remember very little. The pain became a sea in which I was drowning. Then came darkness. </p><p> When I became conscious again, I was still in pain but in a new, localized way. My body was no longer struggling. Its burden was gone. Dale and Matthew, very pale, were beside me and the physician stood watchfully by. Uncle Armand and Madame Montaigle had left the room. </p><p> "You're alive," Matthew said. "But there is no child. It was one or the other and I chose you." </p><p> I smiled. I thanked him. I held his hand. </p><p> I had rarely been so angry in my life.<br> </p><p> The anger wouldn't go away and mingled with it was a bleak misery that refused to lift and which did not even seem to have much to do with my grief for the lost baby, although I did indeed grieve. I was glad when Matthew told me that Uncle Armand had managed to baptize him, and that he had been laid in consecrated ground. He had been called Pierre, after Matthew's father. Physically, I got better, and I let Matthew think that my silences, my inability to smile, were all on account of grief. I knew I was hurting him but I could not help myself. My mind was sick and would not heal. </p><p> But by the fourth of April, Matthew was growing worried because I was so remote from him, and over that momentous dinner table, he said so. </p><p> We were not alone. Uncle Armand was dining with us as he usually did, and the butler, Doriot, was waiting on us. So was Roger Brockley, my English manservant. Fran Dale was actually married to Brockley although I still called her Dale, because she had been in my service before Brockley joined me. </p><p> They were both well into their forties, solid people, very English -- Dale a little too given to complaining and slightly marked by childhood smallpox, but handsome in her way and very much attached to me; Brockley, stocky and dignified, with a high, polished forehead, a dusting of pale gold freckles, a slight country accent, a gift for expressionless jokes, and a knack of combining respect with criticism which over the years had inspired me with trust and exasperation in roughly equal proportions. </p><p> Brockley had originally been my groom, but when we came to Blanchepierre, the stables were full of grooms, and he had carved out a highly individual niche for himself, acting as my personal messenger and serving me at meals. Doriot didn't like it, though Brockley tried to be generally helpful and not usurp the butler's authority. </p><p> Brockley was at the sideboard, spooning wine sauce over my fish steaks, when Matthew said: "I have asked the physician to call tomorrow, Ursula. You are not recovering your strength or your spirits as you should. We've had a sad loss, but it's not the end of the world, you know." </p><p> I gazed down the table, past the silver dishes and the very beautiful silver salt and the matching candlesticks. The day was bright and the candles weren't lit, but they were there as decoration. We always dined in this formal fashion, with the length of the table between us. Blanchepierre was a very formal place. </p><p> There he sat, my husband, Matthew, whose dark, diamond-shaped eyes and dramatic black eyebrows, whose tall, loose-jointed frame and graceful movements, had captivated me long ago. He was good-hearted, too; essentially kind. In the end, after a long struggle, I had chosen him and Blanchpierre over a life as a lady of Queen Elizabeth's Presence Chamber and an agent in the employ of her Secretary of State, Sir William Cecil. I had been willing to live with Matthew as a Catholic, here in France, even though I remembered all too well the cruelties wrought in England by Mary Tudor in the name of that same religion. </p><p> Matthew loved me, and I had thought I loved him, but at this moment, he looked like a stranger. </p><p> "I don't like the physician," I said. "I'd rather not see him." </p><p> "That's a little ungrateful, isn't it? He saved your life, after all. I'm sure he can prescribe something for you -- a tonic, perhaps." </p><p> "Dale can make a tonic up for me," I said. "She is quite skilled in such things. Even I have a little knowledge of herb lore." </p><p> "The physician surely knows more than either you or Dale. Why don't you like him?" </p><p> Doriot and Brockley brought the fish steaks to the table and began to serve them. I tried to think of a way to answer Matthew, but couldn't. </p><p> "Well?" he said. "Ursula, I'm worried about you and these silences of yours are one of the reasons. What is the matter with you? If I ask you a question, why can't you reply?" </p><p> Sometimes, I knew, it was because I was too lost in depression to hear him. But at other times, and this was one of them, it was because I knew he wouldn't like the answer. I stared at him and then, without speaking, started to eat. </p><p> "What is wrong with the physician? Ursula, I mean to have an answer. So will you say something, please?" </p><p> He had never pressed so hard before, and in any case, the answer was festering in me. I set down the piece of bread with which I was mopping up the sauce. </p><p> "Very well," I said. "The last time he came here was to my lying-in chamber. He said there was a chance of saving me or the child, but not both, and he asked you which he should try to save. He asked you. But I was conscious. I was crying out that I didn't want to die. Why didn't he ask me instead? He never even spoke to me. I might have been just a log of wood." </p><p> "Ursula, for the love of God! A physician would always ask the husband in such a case. Naturally." </p><p> "I've just said, I was crying out that I didn't want to die. Why didn't he just set about saving my life without further ado?" </p><p> "And leave me with no say in the matter?" </p><p> "It was my life! I was terrified of dying -- terrified!" </p><p> "That was needless," said Uncle Armand. "You had heard Mass and been shriven only an hour or two before your pains began. You had nothing to fear." </p><p> "Yes, I had!" I snapped at him. "I wanted to live!" </p><p> "I know," said Matthew. "And I wanted you to live too. I told him to save you. You know that. The child was a son but believe me, I cared nothing for that, if only I could have you back, safe." </p><p> "But where would I be now if you had chosen otherwise?" </p><p> "Ursula, what is all this? I saved your life!" Matthew thundered. "You're completely unreasonable." </p><p> "And unwomanly, I fear." Uncle Armand shook a reproving head. "What you should have done, my child, was declare that you wished your infant to be saved. Your husband would still have chosen your life instead, of that I feel sure. The very purpose behind asking the husband is to free the woman from the burden of choosing between her child and herself. But..." </p><p> "I didn't ask to be freed of it!" </p><p> "The last time you saw the physician," said Matthew, "you were delirious. I think, Uncle Armand, that Ursula cannot be blamed for anything she said at that time." </p><p> "Blamed!" I shouted. </p><p> "Calm yourself. I also think," said Matthew, "that you spent too long dancing attendance on that red-haired heretic queen in England. She used to raise her voice quite often, if I remember aright, and you are talking the kind of nonsense that she might very well talk." </p><p> "It isn't nonsense." I tried to speak more quietly. "I still greatly admire Elizabeth," I added. </p><p> "But you left her service because she and Cecil between them had betrayed you." </p><p> "It felt like that at the time. But since then, I've come to understand them better. I've had time to think." </p><p> "I would have expected," said Matthew, "that now you are here in my home, you could have left the thinking to your husband, as other women do. It is not a feminine occupation. But since you have been thinking -- to what conclusions have you come? Do you regret staying with me?" </p><p> "It would be most shameful if you did," said Uncle Armand, signaling Brockley for a little more fish. Doriot and Brockley were continuing to serve as imperturbably as though we were all discussing ...</p></p><h2>Completely Loved: Recognizing God&#39;s Passionate Pursuit of Us (Loving Jesus Without Limits)</h2><p>Did you know that God is pursuing you, not out of anger or disappointment but because He desires an intimate relationship with you?

Unlike some authors who read their own work, Ethridge has a youthful voice that is easy to listen to as she paints the bright word pictures that deliver her message of the importance of having intimacy with God. She often uses plays on words, such as intimacy, which she defines as in-to-me-see. Scripture supports the personal examples she provides to demonstrate why God can use anyone in spite of his or her life circumstances. Ethridges rich vocal personality articulates Gods passionate pursuit of His creation, making those who listen feel enveloped in His love.

But an old wooden cupboard and a special key brought his unusual toy to life. And then even stranger things began to happen- wonderful, secret, dangerous...magical things.</p></p><p>What could be better than a magic cupboard that turns small toys into living creatures? Omri's big brother has no birthday present for him, so he gives Omri an old medicine cabinet he's found. Although their mother supplies a key, the cabinet still doesn't seem like much of a present. But when an exhausted Omri dumps a plastic toy Indian into the cabinet just before falling asleep, the magic begins. Turn the key once and the toy comes alive; turn it a second time and it's an action figure again. <p> <i>The Indian in the Cupboard</i> is one of those rare books that is equally appealing to children and adults. The story of Omri and the Indian, Little Bear, is replete with subtle reminders of the responsibilities that accompany friendship and love. For kids, it's a great yarn; for most parents, it's also a reminder that Omri's wrenching decision to send his toy back to its own world is not so different from the recognition of their children's emerging independence. </p><p> <i>The Indian in the Cupboard</i> is also available in Spanish (<i>La Llave Magica</i>.)

He contends that the 1809 war, with its massive and evenly matched armies, increased firepower, and large-scale slaughter, had more in common with the American Civil War and subsequent conflicts than with the Napoleonic campaigns that preceded it. Epstein examines 1809 in terms of the evolving new systems of recruitment, organization, and command used by both sides. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc.

Everyone in the family agreed to support the heiress, ravishing raven-haired Camilla Galloway, in her court petition -- except dreary Cousin Deirdre, who suddenly demanded a small fortune for her signature. Then Deirdre had a terrible accident. That was when the young London barristers handling the trust -- Cantrip, Selena, Timothy, Ragwort, and Julia -- summoned their Oxford friend Professor Hilary Tamar to Lincoln&#39;s Inn. Julia thinks it&#39;s murder. Hilary demurs. Why didn&#39;t the heiress die? But when the accidents escalate and they learn of the naked lunch at Uncle Rupert&#39;s, Hilary the Scholar embarks on the most perilous quest of all: the truth....</p><p>Sarah Caudwell is also the author of Thus Was Adonis Murdered, The Shortest Way to Hades, and The Sirens Sang of Murder. She studied law at St. Anne&#39;s College, Oxford, was called to the Chancery Bar, and practiced as a barrister for several years in Lincoln&#39;s Inn. She then became a member of the legal section of a major London bank, where she found herself specializing in international tax planning. Sarah Caudwell died in January 2000.In the midst of a legal wrangle among heirs, the single dissenter winds up dead. Did the dreary young woman fall off a roof, or was she pushed? To find out, the stuffy solicitors of said heirs engage an Oxford don, Professor Hillary Tamor, to ferret out the truth. The good professor, as interpreted by Eva Haddon, details the matter with keen observation, wit, and grace. Both author and narrator provide vivid characterization and ample humor, if not much suspense. An irritating distortion mars even moderately loud passages throughout.

But breaking away from tragedy and personal betrayal is at least a step in the right direction. Her dead sister&#x2019;s fate still torments her, as does her long-missing niece&#x2019;s disappearance. Lizzie hopes to find the mysteriously vanished child here, amid the coming ice and snow. But in the Great North Woods, something darker and more dangerous than punishing winter is also bound for Bearkill.<br> &nbsp;<br> The town is a world apart in more than distance&#x2014;full of people who see everything, say little, and know more than they&#x2019;ll share with an outsider. The only exceptions are the handsome state cop who once badly broke Lizzie&#x2019;s heart and desperately wants another chance&#x2014;and Lizzie&#x2019;s new boss, sheriff Cody Chevrier, who&#x2019;s counting on her years of homicide experience to help him solve his most troubling case, before it&#x2019;s too late.<br> &nbsp;<br> A rash of freak accidents and suicides has left a string of dead men&#x2014;all former local cops. Now the same cruel eyes that watched them die are on Lizzie&#x2014;and so is the pressure to find out what sort of monster has his hooks in this town, what his ruthless game is, and just how brutally he&#x2019;ll play to win. Whatever the truth is, its twisted roots lie in the desolate backwoods of Aroostook County: where the desperate disappear, the corrupt find shelter, and the innocent lose everything. It&#x2019;s there that a cunning and utterly cold-blooded killer plans the fate of the helpless lives at his mercy&#x2014;one of whom may be the lost child Lizzie will do anything to save. As a blizzard bears down, and Bearkill&#x2019;s dark secrets claw their way to the surface, Lizzie gears up for a showdown that could leave the deep, driven snow stained blood red.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>Winter at the Door</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sarah Graves writes with grace and intelligence, and a love for her state shines through in this stylish debut of a new series set against Maine&#x2019;s dark and foreboding forests.

She is currently working on her next novel in the Lizzie Snow series, <i>The Girls She Left Behind</i>.<p>One</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>two weeks later</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;This is not what I signed up for,&#x201d; Lizzie Snow said. &#x201c;And you know it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She gazed around in dismay at the small, dusty office whose plate-�glass front window looked out at the remote northern town of Bearkill, Maine. The office walls were covered with fake wood paneling, the ceiling was stained 1960s-�era acoustical tiles, and the ratty beige carpet was worn through to the backing in the traffic areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You said I&#x2019;d be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; The furnishings consisted of a beat-�up metal desk, an office chair with one of its cheap plastic wheels missing, and a metal shelf rack of the kind used to store car parts in an auto supply store, plus one old phone book.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not that sticking her in a <i>better</i> office would&#x2019;ve helped. &#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on patrol,&#x201d; she finished, trying to control her temper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Squinting out across Main Street, she told herself that the town, at least, wasn&#x2019;t so bad. Two rows of small businesses and shops, a luncheonette, and a corner bar called Area 51 whose sign featured a big-�eyed alien with a cocktail in its hand made up the downtown district. There was a laundromat, a flower shop, a supermarket, and an office supply place called The Paper Chase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All were apparently doing business, though not exactly thriving; years ago in the post-�WWII housing boom and for decades after, timber harvesting had supported this community and many others like it. But with the lumber industry sadly diminished, the area&#x2019;s agriculture&#x2014;�potatoes, oats, broccoli&#x2014;�couldn&#x2019;t take up the slack, and there wasn&#x2019;t much else here to work at.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Or so she&#x2019;d read. Bearkill was one of many Maine towns she&#x2019;d Googled before coming here, but this was her first visit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Too bad it&#x2019;s not my last&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She supposed she should&#x2019;ve liked the little town&#x2019;s air of brave defiance, stuck way out here in the woods with not even a movie theater or a Whole Foods, much less a museum or jazz club.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But, dear God, there wasn&#x2019;t even a Starbucks, the only hair salon was called The Cut-�n-�Run, and if you could buy any makeup but Maybelline in this town, she&#x2019;d eat her hat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I know the job&#x2019;s not like I described,&#x201d; Aroostook County sheriff Cody Chevrier admitted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Six-�two and one-�eighty or so with close-�clipped silver hair and the perma-�tanned skin of a guy who spent a lot of his time outdoors, summer and winter, Chevrier was in his late fifties but still trimly athletic-looking in his tan uniform.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Since you and I talked last, though, there&#x2019;ve been a few developments.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah? Like what, a crime wave?&#x201d; she asked skeptically. On the sixty-�mile drive north up Route 1 from the Aroostook County seat of Houlton this morning, she&#x2019;d seen little evidence of that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Farms, forest land, widely spaced homes and small roadside businesses were the norm here, she&#x2019;d seen after filling out the stacks of pre-�employment paperwork Chevrier had put before her. Around the courthouse and the sheriff&#x2019;s office, men and women in business garb carried briefcases and drove late-�model sedans, but once she&#x2019;d left Houlton it was good old boys in gimme caps and women in pastel sweatshirts all the way. Nobody looked as if they had a whole lot to steal, or the inclination to steal anything, either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You might be surprised at what goes on in this area,&#x201d; said Chevrier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh-�huh.&#x201d; She eyed him sideways. &#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And moonbeams might fly out of her ass the next time she passed gas, too. But she&#x2019;d been a cop for a dozen years now, and she wasn&#x2019;t betting on it; crime-�wise&#x2014;�<i>and otherwise,</i> she thought bleakly&#x2014;�this place was deader than Elvis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You said I&#x2019;d be on the road,&#x201d; she reminded Chevrier again. &#x201c;First with a partner and then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Aroostook County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department&#x2019;s website, there were 2,500 miles of public roadway in &#x201c;the County&#x201d; (locals always used the capital <i>C</i>), which spread across half of northern Maine. Eight thousand miles more of privately maintained roads belonged to major landowners, primarily lumber companies. In area the County was larger than Rhode Island and Connecticut combined; its 71,000-�plus residents generated approximately 600 criminal complaints and 400 traffic incidents each quarter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the sheriff&#x2019;s department served court orders and warrants, moved prisoners and psych patients, worked with the Maine DEA, the warden service, Border Patrol, and Homeland Security, and staffed a seventy-�two-�bed county jail; the transport detail alone logged 160,000 miles per year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And none of it could afford to get screwed up just because she was a new deputy. She&#x2019;d need an experienced partner for a while before working a patrol assignment on her own; that much she&#x2019;d understood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, though, she&#x2019;d be out there solo: keeping her eyes and ears open, asking polite questions and maybe a few not-�so-�polite ones. Searching&#x2014;�</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And sooner or later finding. If, that is, it turned out that there was really anything&#x2014;�any<i>one</i>&#x2014;�up here to find&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Out of the blue, Chevrier asked the question she&#x2019;d seen on his face when he&#x2019;d first met her in person the day before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So, you will pass the physical, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Aroostook County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department&#x2019;s mandatory pre-�employment fitness test, he meant. Sit-�ups, push-�ups, a mile-�and-�a-�half run&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all required in order to finalize her hiring.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; she replied, controlling her impatience. Back in Boston, where she&#x2019;d been a homicide detective until a few weeks ago&#x2014;�<i>dear God, was it only that long?</i>&#x2014;�she&#x2019;d done those things religiously at the police academy gym on Williams Avenue. Six days a week, sometimes seven&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Usually seven. It was among the joys of being a woman cop: to the dirtbags&#x2014;�and to some of your coworkers, too, though they&#x2019;d deny it&#x2014;�you were a pushover until proven otherwise. So there was no sense allowing for even the slightest chance of it being true; on a good day, she bench-�pressed 220. She just didn&#x2019;t look like she could, or at any rate not at first glance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Short, spiky black hair expertly cut, blood-�red nails matching her lipstick, and smoky-�dark eye makeup meticulously applied took care of that, as did her scent, which was Guerlain&#x2019;s Rose Barbare<i>,</i> and her high-�heeled black boots rising to the tops of her tightly muscled calves, snug as a second skin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She had no uniforms here yet, so today she wore black jeans, a white silk T-�shirt and navy hoodie, and a butter-�soft leather jacket. The look wasn&#x2019;t fancy, but perhaps partly as a result of all those gym hours it was effective; exiting Chevrier&#x2019;s vehicle, she&#x2019;d attracted second glances from several of Bearkill&#x2019;s passing citizens, some even approving.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some not so much. Hey, screw them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do just fine,&#x201d; she repeated evenly, &#x201c;on the fitness tests.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Chevrier replied. <i>If you say so,</i> his face added, but not as doubtfully this time; whether it was the confidence in her voice, a closer appraisal of her gym-�toned form, or a combination of the two that convinced him, she didn&#x2019;t know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Or care. &#x201c;In that case, you&#x2019;re the new community liaison officer here in Bearkill,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;First one we&#x2019;ve ever had.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gesturing at the dingy room, he added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll set you up with account numbers for furniture and supplies, and we&#x2019;ve got people on contract to get the place cleaned and painted for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the way here, he&#x2019;d explained that her assignment had changed because a federal grant he&#x2019;d been expecting to lose had come through after all. So he had funding for this new position.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But he hadn&#x2019;t described her duties, an omission she thought odd. Could it be he believed that being from a big city meant she already knew the usual activities and objectives of such a job? Or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was she supposed to invent them herself?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her hiring had been fast-�tracked, too: a mere two weeks between the time he&#x2019;d learned that she was in the coastal Maine town of Eastport&#x2014;�her first stop after leaving Boston&#x2014;�and this morning&#x2019;s paper�work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was another thing she felt curious about: why he&#x2019;d been so interested in her, and in her homicide experience especially. She made a mental note to ask him about all of it if he didn&#x2019;t volunteer the information soon, just as a husky teenager on an old balloon-�tired Schwinn bike pedaled by the big front window.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sporting a nose stud and a silvery lip ring and with his pale hair twisted into utterly improbable-�looking dreadlocks, the kid wore faded jeans and a drab T-�shirt and was tattooed on all visible parts of his body except his face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Really?</i> she thought in surprise. So apparently not every young male in Aroostook County was a good old boy; she wondered if Tattoo Kid here was a skilled fighter, or if he survived looking the way he did by trading something other than punches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;department credit card for gas, but we do repairs back at the house,&#x201d; Chevrier was saying, meaning that vehicles were taken care of in Houlton, she thought, likely through a local car dealer&#x2019;s service department.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which as news was not earthshaking, nor was the rest of the procedural stuff he was reciting. Lizzie slipped a hand into her jacket pocket and withdrew a creased photograph of a little girl who was about nine years old.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The child had straight, shoulder-�length blond hair and blue eyes, and wore a red, white, and blue striped cape of some shiny material; she held a small banner that read happy 4th of july!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>I&#x2019;m coming, honey,</i> Lizzie thought at the photograph, worn from frequent handling. <i>I&#x2019;ll find you. And when I do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She tucked the picture away again. It was why she had left Boston, why she was here in Maine at all: an anonymous tip, her first hint in years that she had living family after all. But she still didn&#x2019;t know the end of that last sentence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>When I do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then what?</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;get yourself a PO box right away so we can send you your paychecks,&#x201d; Chevrier was saying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t even sure that the child in the photograph was the one she sought. Her younger sister Cecily&#x2019;s infant daughter, Nicolette, had gone missing from Eastport eight years earlier, right after Cecily&#x2019;s own mysterious death.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If she wasn&#x2019;t a sad little pile of bones in an unmarked grave somewhere, Nicki was Lizzie&#x2019;s only living kin, and after a long time of believing the child was dead there&#x2019;d been other hints recently, too, that instead she was somewhere in northern Maine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Lizzie wasn&#x2019;t sure of that, either, and anyway, northern Maine was a big place. There was, she realized for the thousandth time, so much she didn&#x2019;t know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>I should have done more, started sooner.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>I shouldn&#x2019;t have just let it go.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But she had; for one thing, she&#x2019;d needed to earn a living, and there was no undoing any of it now. Tattoo Kid pedaled by the front windows a second time, his eyes meeting hers briefly and then looking quickly away again as Chevrier went on:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get a requisition going for your computer stuff, have a carpet crew come up from Bangor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She turned to him. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His brow furrowed. &#x201c;So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what, you mean you&#x2019;ve decided that you don&#x2019;t want the spot?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For a moment she was tempted; she&#x2019;d have loved telling him to take his job and stick it. After all, who offered somebody one position, then waited until they showed up before informing them that it had turned into something entirely different? But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m taking it.&#x201d; She crossed to the desk, grabbed the phone book, and threw it into a corner. Who used a phone book anymore, either? &#x201c;But only on two conditions. First&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She aimed a finger at the front window. &#x201c;You want me to build friendly relationships with the people here in Bearkill? I mean, that&#x2019;s what a liaison officer does, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She had the funniest feeling that Chevrier might not know quite what one of those did himself. But never mind:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s only one way I can quick-�start relationships with these folks&#x2014;�&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the far end of the downtown block, the office supply store was somehow still alive, while at the other end a run-�down gas station survived, as did the tiny convenience store attached.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;�and that&#x2019;s for me to buy stuff from them.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which was also true in Boston, and anywhere else there were cops: coffee and a lottery ticket at the bodega, an apple at the fruit stand, sandwiches at the luncheonette&#x2014;�you bought a little of this or that anywhere you thought you might get the chance to talk to people, hear things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Supplies, cleaning, painting, new tires for the squad car whether it needs &#x2019;em or not,&#x201d; she went on. &#x201c;All of it has to get done locally. And as for computer equipment?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She turned to face him. &#x201c;Look, Sheriff, I&#x2019;ve got my own reasons for wanting the job you&#x2019;re trying to foist on me, okay? So I&#x2019;m not walking away even though you know damned well you absolutely deserve it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He shrugged again, acknowledging this. &#x201c;But,&#x201d; she went on, &#x201c;as far as computers and printer paper and everything else this place needs?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She waved a hand around the bleak little storefront. &#x201c;Either that office supply joint down the street is about to hit a big payday, <i>and</i> my car gets serviced here in town, or you can forget you met me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She expected pushback about the car, at least; regulations, routine. But instead he kept nodding at her demands, which among other things gave her an even stronger sense of how very much he wanted her here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Curiouser and curiouser. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That makes sense. Do it however you want. You&#x2019;ll need purchase orders, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Not so fast. You haven&#x2019;t heard the other condition.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chevrier looked wary&#x2014;�&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;&#x2014;�as the tattooed kid on the bike rolled by yet a third time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Briskly she zipped her jacket, settled her black leather satchel on her shoulder, and pulled the creaky front door open, waving him out ahead of her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; she told him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The kid with the piercings, body art, and blond dreadlocks was now halfway down the street, looking back at them. She yanked the balky door shut, then jiggled the key in the lock until the tumblers fell sluggishly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m hungry. We&#x2019;ll talk over lunch.

This book reveals, in the simplest way, how to still the mind and become fully present and awake in the truth of life. Perhaps the most important aspect of this book is the author&#39;s unique insight into the nature of the mind and ego. He describes in detail how the ego&#39;s resistance to Presence is the primary obstacle to awakening and how we can overcome that resistance in a simple and effective way. Each page of this book reveals a part of the mystery. There are hidden keys to awakening on every page. It is like a road map home.</p><p>Leonard Jacobson is a modern mystic and spiritual teacher who is deeply committed to guiding and supporting others in their journey towards wholeness. He has been running workshops and seminars for the past 20 years throughout the U.S., Europe and Australia. He is the founder of the Conscious Living Foundation and in 2005 he was awarded the Peace Prize by Religious Science Inernational.Jacobson, author of four books, is a respected teacher, healer, and mystic. Journey Into Now, his newest publication, offers long-time travelers on the spiritual path and new seekers a detailed map to enlightenment and a clear description of what it will look and feel like when one gets there. Of special interest is his inclusion, at the end of the book, of his own very personal awakening experiences. Spiritual seekers need look no further than this book to find the inspiration, challenge, and direction needed to become a fully awakened Being.. --Kristine Morris, ForeWard Magazine<br><br>Journey into Now cuts through so much of the spiritual mumbo-jumbo that seems to accumulate in the hears on the path. It's not about the idea of being present, it's simply being present. What Leonard does in this book is step you through the obstacles to being present and give you exercises that lead you into the present moment. --Will Arndt, Producer and Director of What the Bleep<br><br>Journey into Now is a must read for anyone interested in becoming more fully present. It is one of the best books ever written about the nature of the mind and how to overcome the many and subtle blocks to awakening, including the resistance of the ego. It reveals in the simplest terms what the mystics and Masters have been speaking of for centuries. Simple and practical and yet profoundly mystical, Journey into Now is for those whose hearts and souls long to awaken. --David Welch, Producer of Peaceful Warrior</p><h2>Reel Justice</h2><p>From the earliest days of the movies, filmmakers have turned to the courtroom for stories because it is an ideal setting for both drama and comedy. Fans of those courtroom movies can turn to Reel Justice for a verdict on both recent and classic courtroom films. Informative and entertaining, Reel Justice rates trial scenes in films on a one-to-four-gavel scale, with four being a classic and one being &#34;ask for a new trial.&#34; Authors Paul Bergman and Michael Asimow, both accomplished law professionals, discuss the cultural messages encoded in the films, point out what went right and wrong in scenes where liberties were taken, and even answer a few legal questions along the way. Completely revised and reformatted from the successful first edition, this new edition of Reel Justice includes more than two dozen recent movies as well as many older favorites that weren&#39;t covered in the first version. Just a few of the films reviewed: * A Time to Kill * Legally Blonde * Philadelphia * Inherit the Wind * A Few Good Men * The Devil&#39;s Advocate * I Am Sam * Intolerable Cruelty * Rules of Engagement * Twelve Angry Men * Ghosts of Mississippi * Runaway Jury Reel Justice is an indispensable video guide for film viewers who want the legal lowdown on courtroom scenes.</p><p>Paul Bergman is a professor of law emeritus at UCLA Law School and frequently lectures to lawyers and judges on how films depict law and legal culture. He has written numerous articles on the depiction of law and lawyers in films, as well as several books on evidence, trial advocacy, legal counseling, and legal processes for non-lawyers.<br><br>Michael Asimow is professor of law emeritus at UCLA Law School. He specializes in administrative law and has written numerous books and articles about law and lawyers in movies and television, including <i>Law and Popular Culture: A Course Book</i>.In this informative, entertaining, and unique book, the authors, two UCLA law professors, dissect a broad cross section of courtroom films with wit, humor, and professional expertise but without any stilted legal jargon. They organize the films into categories ranging from true stories (Inherit the Wind), comedy (My Cousin Vinny), and military (A Few Good Men) to lawyer/client relationships (Jagged Edge), civil cases (Kramer vs. Kramer), and unusual judges/jurors (The Devil and Daniel Webster). A succinct plot and character synopsis for each film is followed by a legal analysis of the case that discusses evidence, legal procedures, testimonies, juries, validity of actions by the attorneys, and more. The authors raise a number of provocative questions and suggest that arriving at true justice is not always a straightforward affair. Very enjoyable reading, this book will be appreciated by film enthusiasts as well as by those interested in the various legal, social, and ethical dilemmas in the films.

In his previous well-received volumes of photographs, Hugo offers unflinching yet striking portraits of humans, animals, societies, and landscapes that shock and disturb, but also demand our attention. In Permanent Error, he documents a garbage dump in Ghana that has become the repository for discarded computers from around the world. These haunting images document the true cost of a misguided policy-the shipping of millions of tons of obsolete computers to developing countries. The computers are burned to extract valuable metals, effectively turning the site into a toxic wasteland that contaminates air, soil, and groundwater for miles around. These amazing portraits tell a story of a marginal community overwhelmed by poverty, but where human strength and resilience shine through the inhuman conditions Hugo lays bare.</p><p>PIETER HUGO's previous books include The Hyena &amp; Other Men and Nollywood (both by Prestel). He lives in Cape Town, South Africa.</p><h2>Peddlers and Post Traders: The Army Sutler on the Frontier (UNIVERSITY OF UTAH PUBLICATIONS IN THE AMERICAN WEST)</h2><p>The army sutler was a civilian who sold comestibles and small wares to men under arms. In America, as in Europe, sutlers were originally camp followers, but when the army realized that these men helped stabilize frontier military life, suttling became a formal military support activity.<br>During the course of the nineteenth century, the suttling trade increased in complexity and profitability, and attracted a number of opportunists. Although sutlers provided a much-needed service, these men illegally sold whiskey to soldiers and Indians, and during President Grant's administration a number of suttling slots were peddled by officials to the highest bidder.<br>The ranks of sutlers peaked during the Civil War, but the position was then abolished because of their scandalous wartime activities. Reinstated In 1867 to fill the needs of emigrants, suttling remained active until the end of the century, when it was replaced by the post exchange (PX).<br>Author David Delo examines the changing nature of sutlery and its practitioners during the nineteenth century and shows how history has emphasized sutlers' disruptive behavior without giving due credit to their contributions as entrepreneurs.<br>This is an accessible work on an important group of figures in American history.</p><p></p><h2>Book of Discipline 1996 English</h2><p>The Discipline, the book of law for The UMC, sets forth the laws, plan, polity, and process by which United Methodists govern themselves.

This text is a serious attempt to identify these ideological origins. It demonstrates the way in which Nazism was influenced by powerful occult and millenarian sects that thrived in Germany and Austria at the turn of the century. Their ideas and symbols filtered through to nationalist-racist groups associated with the infant Nazi party and their fantasies were played out with terrifying consequences in the Third Reich: Auschwitz, Sobibor and Treblinka are the hellish museums of the Nazi apocalypse. This bizarre and fascinating story contains lessons we cannot afford to ignore.</p><p>Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke wasa specialist on Nazi ideology and Research Fellow in the Western Esoteric Tradition, University of Wales Lampeter.</p><h2>The Holocaust</h2><p><p>Designed for secondary school and college student research, this work is a readable history and ready-reference guide to the Holocaust based on the most recent scholarship. It provides the reader with an overview of Nazi Germany's attempt to exterminate world Jewry. Fischel, a leading authority on the Holocaust, combines narrative description, analytical essays, a timeline of events, lengthy biographical profiles, and the text of key primary documents relating to the Nazi plan for the Final Solution to help students gain a comprehensive understanding of the causative factors and major events and personalities that shaped the Nazi genocide. A glossary of key terms, selected tables, and an annotated bibliography of recommended further reading will aid student research.</p><p></p><p>Topical essays designed for the student and general reader provide an accessible historical overview and analysis of Hitler and the Jews, the racial state, genocide, the Final Solution, and resistance to the Nazis. Fischel explains the factors that led to the Holocaust, the implementation of the decision to exterminate the Jews, the response of the free world and the Papacy, the role of righteous gentiles who risked their lives to save Jews, and the resistance of the Jews to their fate under the Nazis. Biographical sketches provide valuable information on the key personalities among both the Nazis and Allies, and the text of key primary documents brings the Nazis blatant plan for genocide to stark reality. In providing valuable information, analysis, and ready-reference features, this work is a one-stop resource on the Holocaust for students, teachers, library media specialists, and interested readers.</p></p><p><p>A one-stop source for in-depth history, analysis, and ready-reference material on the Holocaust.</p><p>JACK R.

This breathtaking showcase of his work illustrates the story of how Thomas Mann came to reach such levels of creative genius. From counter-culture jewelry maker to modern &#34;artrepreneur,&#34; Mann is profiled through both contributor essays and photos of his own extraordinary artwork. Written pieces include a fascinating assessment of Mann&#39;s work in the context of the contemporary craft movement from Lloyd Herman, founding director of the Smithsonian Institution&#39;s Renwick Gallery. A second essay, by National Public Radio commentator and novelist Andrei Codrescu, captures the essence of Mann&#39;s humor, vision and creativity.

The implications for a healthy society are stark.Despite our wondrous technologies and scientific advances, we are nurturing a culture of diffusion and detachment. With our attention scattered among the beeps and pings of a push-button world, we are less and less able to pause, reflect, and deeply connect.In her sweeping quest to unravel the nature of attention and detail its losses, Jackson introduces us to scientists, cartographers, marketers, educators, wired teens, and even roboticists. She offers us a compelling wake-up call, an adventure story, and reasons for hope.As the author shows, neuroscience is just now decoding the workings of attention, with its three pillars of focus, awareness, and judgment, and revealing how these skills can be shaped and taught. This is exciting news for all of us living in an age of overload.Pull over, hit the pause button, and prepare for an eye-opening journey. More than ever, we cannot afford to let distraction become the marker of our time.</p><p><b>Maggie Jackson</b> is an award-winning author and journalist who writes the popular "Balancing Acts" column in the <i>Boston Globe</i>. Her work also has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i> and on National Public Radio, among other national publications. Her acclaimed first book, <i>What&#x2019;s Happening to Home? Balancing Work, Life and Refuge in the Information Age</i>, examined the loss of home as a refuge.Preface to the New Edition<br><br>The pace was brisk and the dialogue frenetic. The one-liners flew thick and fast. In a small New York theater, I was watching <i>Distracted</i>, a play centered on a mother&#x2019;s struggle to cope with her nine-year-old son&#x2019;s attention deficit disorder. The year was 2009. Onstage, a mammoth wall of television monitors spewing sports, news, and sitcoms competed with the actors for the spectators&#x2019; attention. And just in front of me, two women in the audience compounded the evening&#x2019;s cacophony with a running sideshow of phone-checking and chatter.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nearly a decade ago, the world was growing ever more noisy and overloaded. We didn&#x2019;t need to fire up a laptop, a BlackBerry, or its new competitor the iPhone to feel the insistent clamor of modern life. Were these glorious new riches for the heart and mind or an excess to be feared? we wondered. &#x201c;This is an ADD society,&#x201d; <i>Distracted</i>&#x2019;s playwright Lisa Loomer told an interviewer, &#x201c;and I don&#x2019;t know whether this is a dysfunction or a difference.&#x201d; It was the heyday, after all, of our yearning to live in the fast lane. Multitasking was a job description, a sure mark of success. Juggling was a mother&#x2019;s main ambition, the booster rocket to having it all. The problem of distraction, we fervently hoped, was someone else&#x2019;s burden, a malady for those who simply couldn&#x2019;t keep up. We didn&#x2019;t need to pay much attention to the costs of this way of living, or so we thought. The future was ours to splice. <i>Distracted</i>, the play, was billed as a comedy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now the curtain rarely falls on quick-cut, split-focus living. A crisis of inattention has crept onto center stage of an increasingly technological world. Skimming as a mainstay, days mired in trivia, interactions faceless and fractured, perpetually shattered focus: all these are no longer the daily diet of an elite and busy few. Toddlers stare with glazed eyes at the screen of the moment, oblivious to the real world blooming all around them. Early on, they learn that neat, easy answers come from gleaming little boxes that mesmerize their parents. In an era prizing diffusion, the young in effect are groomed to be half there, in class or at the dinner table, in the office or crossing the street. By one estimate, people check their devices an average of eighty-five times or more a day, anxiously searching for yet another dopamine-laced reward. So habituated are we to the siren song of being elsewhere that the mere presence of our own phone, silent and untouched, dramatically undermines our powers of focus. A Pandora&#x2019;s box has sprung open. The struggle now seems real, and we are increasingly torn and uneasy. Americans are almost evenly divided over whether technology has had a positive overall effect on their lives. A majority of middle and high school teachers now believe that technologies do more to distract students than to help them academically. Is all this just the price to be paid for progress? Or are we, at growing cost to our very humanity, chasing a mirage?<br> &nbsp;<br> A decade ago, the signs were all there and this book sounded a prescient warning. We have been perilously slow, however, in waking up to a crisis of our own making and even to the depths of our distraction. Avid multitaskers, for instance, are least able to juggle well and yet are most confident in their ability to do so. Or consider that beckoning phone. In laboratory studies, most of those whose focus is impaired in the presence of their devices later insist that they have <i>not</i> been affected at all. They are oblivious to what scientist Adrian Ward calls the &#x201c;brain drain&#x201d; of distrac-tion. Are we at last willing to question our hubris and take the full measure of our plight? Are we ready to face up to one of the most pressing problems of our age? Today I see our growing unease as a starting point, a potent spur toward an urgently needed reckoning. Attention is the stepping-stone to wisdom, intimacy, and creativity. It is the capacity that decides the fate of the present moment and determines the shape of the future. Without it, we are adrift. It is now time to focus on what matters and give attention its due.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I write these words, a public outcry has erupted, condemning the behemoths of Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Apple for failing to protect our data and our politics from hackers. But perhaps most unsettling has been the discovery that the inventors whom we so revere have themselves been hacking our minds. &#x201c;Their most precious asset, is our most precious asset, our attention, and they have abused it,&#x201d; writes critic Franklin Foer. To public applause, Google turncoat Tristan Harris reveals the brain-hacking tricks that the &#x201c;world&#x2019;s smartest minds&#x201d; have devised to influence people&#x2019;s every online move: the slot machine&#x2013;like bursts of rewards that keep us hooked to our devices, the urgency implied by notifications that constantly interrupt us, and the video autoplay that undercuts a viewer&#x2019;s agency. Day by day, increasingly sophisticated technologies exploit the ceaseless yearning for validation and novelty that underlies human survival. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the devil&#x2019;s work,&#x201d; a sales executive tells me, holding up his phone as we stand outside a funeral home waiting in line to enter a wake. He seems distressed and yet proud that he is constantly needed, or so his device tells him. Out of the corner of my eye, I see him struggle to finish a text just before we reach the casket.<br> &nbsp;<br> Is escape then our best recourse for salvaging what one app developer calls our &#x201c;cognitive liberty&#x201d;? Not long ago, a detox referred to a renunciation of drugs or alcohol by abusers; now it is more often synonymous with a comic-tragic hiatus from technology that&#x2019;s open to all. A grand-mother relates that her friends force their grandchildren to park their screens in baskets by the front door when they visit. Professors assign brief withdrawals to tremulous students. Joining a burgeoning market-place for digital detox retreats, hotels from Paris to Pittsburgh offer to lock up guests&#x2019; devices before ushering them to tech-free spas or suites. The off button, we believe, can keep distraction at bay, allowing for a magical restoration of all that we have lost in a time of stolen attention. It offers a Romantic hope, a page from Rousseau: if we can withdraw from our devices, we can be cleansed of the toxins of digital living and recover the gifts of an attentive mind. We once again can frolic, as Keats wrote in <i>Ode to Psyche</i>, in &#x201c;the wreath&#x2019;d trellis of a working brain.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet so often we falter, eschewing or outright failing the Facebook Fast or Media Sabbath. Sixty-five percent of American adults deem periodic unplugging important for their mental health, yet less than a third of those who say this do so. In one experiment, most of one thousand college students from ten countries couldn&#x2019;t last twenty-four hours without media, even for a class assignment. Some quit after just half an hour. When I interviewed University of Maryland students taking part in a pilot study for the project, many admitted to the merits of the detox. They had paid more attention to their studies and felt more productive. Yet the silence and aloneness of an unmediated day unnerved them. &#x201c;I was out of my element almost,&#x201d; said a junior, a journalism major from Boston. &#x201c;I had no connection to anything.&#x201d; In the end, the grand forces of distraction seem too relent-less, too inevitable, and surely too inviting to be tamed with a mere respite. And so we increasingly turn back to the machine for answers, hoping that the mechanized marvels that beset us can protect us as well.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Technology Promised to Make Living Easier, but Complicated It Instead. The Answer: More Tech,&#x201d; trumpets the headline of a recent <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article about the apps and gadgets that can help us curb our tech dependence. Extending the detox to small slivers of the day, the spartan LightPhone or popular Freedom or Concentrate apps block out parts or all of the enticing Web. Or we can take a step further and ask our machinery to curate our moment-to-moment focus: the ebb and flow of our inbox, the news and jokes we see, the times we wake or sleep. By allowing a meditation app to choose which practice that I next under-take, I am for a moment giving it free rein over my mind. Soon screens will have &#x201c;attentive user interfaces&#x201d; that watch us in order to learn when and how best to interrupt us with that urgent call from the boss or extra-neous text from mom. Their efforts to score &#x201c;maximum informational throughput,&#x201d; we should note, will be drawn from studying human habits that are in turn increasingly shaped by machines.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even as we begin to rue what technology does <i>to</i> us, we are asking all the more what it can do <i>for</i> us. Our species always has been a tool user extraordinaire, a crafty seeker of ways to augment its capabilities. Now as we grow seamlessly connected to enchanting artificial intelligences, we begin to treat them less as tools and more as coaches, sages, nursemaids, and confidantes. More than a third of smartphone users rate their devices as more than or equally important to their close friends. Tell me, Alexa, should I date this guy? How do I look today? What should I do next? Users pose these kinds of questions to the AI-driven assistants, now used by twenty-five million Americans. To outsource control of our attention to the devices that we yearn to trust and revere is but a simple step. With the flick of a switch, we can off-load care of our unruly minds and cure our human failings. Or can we? When my daughter was eleven years old, administrators at her school decided to lend each student a laptop for use in class and at home. Soon alarmed by the tide of easy diversions that had been unleashed, the school installed a blocking app called &#x201c;Self-Control&#x201d; on each child&#x2019;s computer, a solution that confused my daughter. &#x201c;Mom,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s not <i>really</i> self-control!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We are right to worry, and to experiment. In the digital era, our beguiling technologies increasingly work to undermine our focus. At the same time, when treated as tools and not as panacea, our devices can scaffold our nascent efforts to curb distraction. Going forward, technology will play no singular role in influencing our future. But as my daughter sensed, we fall short in resolving the crisis of distraction when we narrow our gaze to the wonders or perils, the absence or presence, of the machine. Today we are failing to ask the right questions of our devices, and above all we are failing to ask enough of ourselves. And that is a void that no detox or app can fill. The detox, for instance, offers a fleeting taste of a slower time. Yet all too often it is largely an empty gesture, devoid of lasting change. Stepping away, we come face-to-face with our inherently distractible natures, now made even more so by the rhythms and values of our age. Distraction, we discover, is not just all around us. It is also now more than ever within. And that is the moment when we should not falter&#x2014;the time when the hard work of learning to manage our attention can begin. The discomfiting challenges raised by distraction cannot be met effortlessly with a mere spate of quiet or the flick of this and that switch. To combat distraction, we cannot retreat from ourselves.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is why the questions most central to reclaiming our focus and to this book begin and end with the human behind the device. What attentional skills do we need most on- or off-line to thrive in an age of overload, and how do we practice them? What hopes and values do we bring to the use and invention of our devices, and how do these often-hidden influences ultimately shape our ability to attend? When is splintered focus to be courted, and when should it be shunned? To turn data into knowledge, mistrust into care, and epidemic distraction into exquisitely engaged minds, we must reclaim these missing perspectives. We must become accountable to the crisis of distraction&#x2014;and to ourselves. Only then can we cultivate the capacity that most defines us: attention.</p><h2>Acoustics.</h2><p>Second Library Copy.

Now Herzer Herrick and Megan Trevante have been assigned the mission to capture the spaceship that supplies the fuel for the whole world. Given that Herzer vaguely thinks orbital decay is something having to do with teeth it should be . . . interesting. With all the usual combat expected in a John Ringo novel, East of the Sun and West of the Moon sheds new light on the bizarre relationship between Herzer and Megan, the politics of the new born world and fascinating details of space technology. .</p><p>John Ringo had visited 23 countries and attended 14 schools by the time he graduated high school. This left him with a wonderful appreciation of the oneness of humanity and a permanent aversion to foreign food. A veteran of the 82nd Airborne, he brings first-hand knowledge of military operations to his fiction. His novels for Baen include the four novels in the New York Times best-selling Posleen Invasion series (A Hymn Before Battle, Gust Front, When the Devil Dances, and Hell&#39;s Faire), his far-future series, of which East of the Sun and West of the Moon is the latest (preceded by There Will be Dragons, Emerald Sea and Against the Tide), and four collaborations with New York Times best-selling author David Weber (March Upcountry, March to the Sea, March to the Stars and We Few).The possible conclusion to the postholocaust series The Council War is a rouser in Ringo's best manner. The New Dynasty warlords are bringing in a shipload of fuel that could give them a vital edge; their opponents have planned to hijack it. Unfortunately, the first Team Icarus has been destroyed, and Herzer Herrick and Megan Travante have to improvise a new one. The sequences in which the new team trains show Ringo's military background, and since many of the new recruits are female survivors of New Dynasty harems, motivation isn't a problem. Sex may be a problem for some readers, but Ringo has the rare knack of showing it as tragic, comic, zany, and lustful all at the same time, depending on who's having it and when. The eventual conclusion of the book is one of those page-turning action scenes that are a Ringo specialty. The question remains, Is the bioengineering of the New Dynasty out as well as down? Probably not, since the book's orcs have started thinking for themselves. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Us? <br> <strong>A:</strong> Will this be on the test? <br> <strong>Q:</strong> God, I hope not. How about I&#x2019;ll be &#x201c;Q&#x201d; and you&#x2019;ll be &#x201c;A.&#x201d; <br> <strong>A:</strong> Sure. Figures you&#x2019;d get to be the exotic, Scrabble-tastic letter. Mom always liked you best.<br> <p></p> <strong>Q:</strong> So your new book, <em>Beauty Queens</em>, is about a planeload of teen beauty queens who crash on a &#x201c;deserted&#x201d; island, which turns out to be the location of a rogue operation running a super-secret arms deal. Hijinks ensue.<br> <strong>A:</strong> Wow, that&#x2019;s exactly what <em>I</em> would&#x2019;ve said.<br> <strong>Q:<strong> </strong></strong>Admit it: This was your chance to scratch your James Bond itch.<strong><strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> </strong></strong>Well, you may only live twice, but I&#x2019;ve seen all the Bond movies about a dozen times. I like it when things blow up. If they can blow up with sequins, so much the better.<strong><strong><br> </strong></strong> <p></p> <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Q:<strong> </strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>The book satirizes consumer culture, reality TV, politics, rom-coms, the beauty industry, and religion while exploring issues of gender, race, sexuality, beauty, and identity.<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br> <strong>A:<strong> </strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>And things go &#x2018;splodey. Don&#x2019;t forget.<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br> <strong>Q:<strong> </strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>And things go &#x2018;splodey. In more ways than one. What was the inspiration for this book?<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br> <strong>A:<strong> </strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>I signed a contract, for starters. The less prosaic answer is that years ago over lunch, my editor David Levithan said, &#x201c;A colleague and I came up with an idea and you have to write it: A plane carrying teen beauty pageant survivors crashes on an island. And...scene!&#x201d; I thought it sounded like great, campy fun&#x2014;a chance for a feminist take on <em>Lord of the Flies</em>. The intervening years have seen some pretty profound and depressing setbacks for women, not just legislatively but in entertainment, too. We went from &#x201c;Norma Rae&#x201d; and &#x201c;Mary Tyler Moore&#x201d; to &#x201c;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&#x201d; and &#x201c;Bride Wars.&#x201d; I was at the store, and even the product names suggested we were broken in some way&#x2014;&#x201c;repair&#x201d; &#x201c;correct&#x201d; &#x201c;age defying.&#x201d; I think there was one product targeted for men and it had some really straightforward name like &#x201c;Moisturizing Lotion. For Men.&#x201d; No judgment just, &#x201c;Oh, hey, you have dry skin? Here&#x2019;s a product to help with that, dude.&#x201d; The end. <p></p> <p>Anyway, I kept coming back to <em>Lord of the Flies</em>. Golding paints a pretty grim picture of humanity. Without the trappings of civilization, the boys devolve into savagery. But for the girls in <em>Beauty Queens,</em> it&#x2019;s almost the opposite: Without the expectations &amp; pressures of civilization, they have the freedom to be themselves&#x2014;or at least to start figuring out who they might be.

Haydn's Ingenious Jesting with Art is a unique critical and historical study of this celebrated aspect of the composer's music and the key role of listeners in its success. "Artful jesting" indicates a strategy that involves the listener as an active interpreter of compositional alternatives in a musical work. Wheelock discusses how Haydn, utilizing the subversive potential of wit in a variety of classical forms, genres, and venues, both challenged and affirmed the musical conventions of his day.<br>The book is divided into three sections, each providing a different perspective on the wit and humor of Haydn's music. Part I, "Coming to Terms," takes a multidisciplinary approach to issues of compositional intent and reception history, focusing on changing values of wit and humor in late eighteenth-century literary sources and reviews of Haydn's music. Chapter 1, "The Musical Joke: A Laughing Matter?" details the productive role of humor in heightening consciousness of play with the most basic classical conventions. Dependent on often subtle ambiguities, these musical jokes challenged listeners' understanding of how convention and invention should interact, engaging them as participants themselves in a process of completing the jest. Chapter 2 traces important distinctions between wit and humor in a broad range of eighteenth-century sources, both German and English. Chapter 3 examines the critical understanding of the composer as humorist. Such views - both favorable and unfavorable - are inextricably linked with changing attitudes toward the proper role of instrumental music, popular taste, and the role of the composer in fulfilling expectations of increasingly mixed audiences.<br>Part II, "Frames of Reference," establishes several models for investigating the process of jesting in Haydn's instrumental works. Chapter 4 explores incongruous manners in the composer's symphonic minuets. Wheelock argues that Haydn's fusing of strictly academic and more popular dance styles subverted the measured dignity and refinement of a "proper" minuet, and that such disturbances of the "humors" actually helped to activate the discovery of wit. Chapter 5, "Engaging Wit in the Chamber," examines the metaphor of conversation in connection with Haydn's Opus 33 string quartets, presenting a convincing case that as the voices of the quartet listen and respond to each other the audience is simultaneously engaged in actively mediating this complex dialogue. Chapter 6 explores the deceptions involved in the symphonic finales, where eccentric motives and procedures focus listeners' attention on predicting their progress. Chapter 7, "The Paradox of Distraction," takes theatrical comedy as a point of departure in locating numerous comic devices akin to fixation, memory lapses, digressions, and incongruous juxtapositions of melody and rhythm.<br>Part III, "The Implicated Listener," examines how Haydn transformed humorous rhetoric into a new aesthetic, and considers the broader implications of comic procedures in instrumental music of the Classic era.<br>Haydn's Ingenious Jesting with Art combines a historical and social perspective with strong critical analysis, appealing not only to students of Haydn's music but also to those interested in the Classic style in general.</p><p></p><h2>Good Dog Carl and the Baby Elephant (Good Dog Carl Collection)</h2><p>Beloved children's icon Good Dog, Carl has his paws full with a mischievous baby elephant who likes backyard wading pools, playgrounds and fruit stands!<br>Since Good Dog, Carl was published 30 years ago the series has sold well over a million books.<br>The appeal of the series lies in the nearly wordless narrative, the lovable and somewhat mischievous Rottweiler and the little girl he takes on secret adventures. These are all present in this wonderful addition to the series. Day&#x2019;s painterly skills are superb and her loving portrayal of the gentle dog and his trusting companion are as winning as ever, and this time an enterprising baby elephant joins the pair.<br>This time Carl and Madeleine visit a children&#x2019;s zoo where the enjoy visiting various baby animals. When they leave for an ice cream cone and a walk around the neighborhood, the little elephant follows them and shares their adventures.</p><p>Alexandra Day and her husband, Harold Darling, established the Green Tiger Press in 1970. In 1983, Harold and Sandra were visiting Zurich, Switzerland, when they came across a volume of old German picture sheets, one of which featured a poodle playing with a baby who was supposed to be taking a nap. This image provided the inspiration for &#34;Good Dog, Carl,&#34; which successfully began what would become an increasingly popular picture book series. The Darling&#39;s dog, a Rottweiler named Toby, was the model for the first book&#39;s main character. Since then, three other Darling Rottweilers have posed as Carl in the sequels. The Darlings now live in Seattle, Washington, where they have a ten-thousand-book library, primarily filled with illustrated children&#39;s books.</p><h2>Walvoord, a tribute</h2><p>Doctrinal Essays in honor of 30 years of Academic Leadership, Some of the articles: Application in Biblical Hermeneutics and Exposition, The Purpose of Tongues in 1 Corinthians, The Rapture in 1 Thessalonians, God, Evil, and Dispensation, Contrasting Views on Sanctification, Premillennialism and the Birth of Narratives.</p><p></p><h2>The Norton Anthology of Poetry: Revised Shorter Edition</h2><p>Represents the grand sweep of poetry in English.

The text includes a chronological survey of Caillebotte&#39;s known works.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchBeautifully illustrated, yet unusual in scope, this volume is a study of contrasts. Wittmer explores the works of French Impressionist painter Gustave Caillebotte by highlighting the artist's love of gardens. The text is a delightful mixture of historic photographs, landscape plans, and a history of Yerres and the family estate, where the artist spent his childhood and early career. Quotations from Louis Audot's 1859 Treatise on the Composition and Ornamentation of Gardens and other period documents, which are used extensively to evoke a leisurely 19th- century tone, are sometimes confusing. However, the main focus is an explorative study of artistic themes and compositions in the form of an extensive, hypothetical walking tour of the estate and the sites of Caillebotte's pre-1879 known works. Also included is a chronology of the artist's life. This eclectic work would be a worthy addition to collections focusing on the decorative arts.<br><i>- Stephen Allan Patrick, East Tennessee State Univ.

Every one of these puzzles calls for conclusions based only on the information provided; the answers don't depend on previous knowledge, memory, wordplay, or deception--just a logical mind. Accept the alternatives that lead to the correct response and discard all faulty assumptions until you've arrived at the only possibility that makes sense. There are eight kinds of puzzle, and in most cases diagrams help organize your results. Here's one example: <i>A supermarket theft has occurred. Someone took a fully loaded cart without paying for the groceries. One of the three suspects is guilty--but which one? The guilty party's statement is true; the other two are false. Who is guilty?</i><br><i>A. B took the cart loaded with groceries</i><br><i>B. A's statement is true</i><br><i>C. A's statement is false</i><br><i>Answer: C is the guilty party.</i><br></p><p>The author resides in Tucson, AZ.<br></p><h2>The Maxx Volume 1 (Wildstorm/DC Comics))</h2><p>Presents the adventures of The Maxx, a homeless superhero who lives in a cardboard box, and his social worker, Julie.</p><p>The Maxx, originally a 35-comic-book series, is a superhero parody whose costumed crusader is an insecure adolescent, his Gotham City the inexplicable world of sex and violence that adolescents find so attractive-repulsive. The Maxx is huge, purple with yellow claws and an upper plate of gleaming choppers. When down, he is homeless in a dumpster. Up or down, he is often with high-school hottie Julie, whose boyfriend, protector, and pet he is. This setup cleverly chimes with angst-drenched teen fantasies and how teen relationships can look to an observer. Maxx fights an unending battle with Mr. Gone and the <i>isz</i> (eyeless ovoids with needle teeth), and his delusion that he is in "Outbacks," an alternate reality that the whole scenario slips in and out of, hilariously complicates everything. Kieth says a common reaction to <i>The Maxx</i> is, "I just don't get it." He doesn't say that, as with adolescence, not getting it <i>is</i> getting it, or that his kaleidoscopic artwork makes it harder to get--but glorious. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This book takes us back in time to an era when Philadelphia&#39;s ballparks were as famous and as much a part of the game as the teams that took the field.</p><p>&#34;An old ballpark has an allure that cannot be dismissed. It evokes warm memories while suggesting another era when baseball was a kinder, gentler game. One cannot simply forget it. It&#39;s grip is far to strong.&#34;Philadelphia&#39;s baseball history goes beyond Shibe Park. Philadelphia&#39;s Old Ballparks is both a documentary and an oral history, providing colorful descriptions of all the old professional parks and the many teams that played in them. Baker Bowl, with its right field wall so close to home plate, for instance, prompted sports writer Red Smith to quip, &#34;It might be exaggerating to say the outfield wall casts a shadow across the infield. But if the right fielder had eaten onions at lunch, the second baseman knew it&#34;. Shibe Park&#39;s idiosyncrasies are also well-documented, as are the others. The recollections of dozens of people: players, owners, vendors, ushers, groundskeepers, and fans have been called upon in recreating the world that was held within those walls.</p><h2>Get the Life You Want: Finding Meaning and Fulfillment through Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</h2><p>How can we be happy?

Although yet to reach his thirtieth year, history had seen fit to bestow upon him titles aplenty: Sword of the Realm to the mad king who sent him to plague us, the Young Hawk to the men who followed him through the trials of war, Darkblade to his Cumbraelin enemies and, as I was to learn much later, Beral Shak Ur to the enigmatic tribes of the Great Northern Forest&#x2014;the Shadow of the Raven.</i></p><p><i>But my people knew him by only one name and it was this that sang in my head continually the morning they brought him to the docks:</i> Hope Killer. Soon you will die and I will see it. Hope Killer.</p><p><i>Although he was certainly taller than most men, I was surprised to find that, contrary to the tales I had heard, he was no giant, and whilst his features were strong they could hardly be called handsome. His frame was muscular but not possessed of the massive thews described so vividly by the storytellers. The only aspect of his appearance to match his legend was his eyes: black as jet and piercing as a hawk&#x2019;s. They said his eyes could strip a man&#x2019;s soul bare, that no secret could be hidden if he met your gaze. I had never believed it but seeing him now, I could see why others would.</i></p><p><i>The prisoner was accompanied by a full company of the Imperial Guard, riding in close escort, lances ready, hard eyes scanning the watching crowd for trouble. The crowd, however, were silent. They stopped to stare at him as he rode through, but there were no shouts, no insults or missiles hurled. I recalled that they knew this man, for a brief time he had ruled their city and commanded a foreign army within its walls, yet I saw no hate in their faces, no desire for vengeance. Mostly they seemed curious. Why was he here? Why was he alive at all?</i></p><p><i>The company reined in on the wharf, the prisoner dismounting to be led to the waiting vessel. I put my notes away and rose from my resting place atop a spice barrel, nodding at the captain. &#x201c;Honour to you, sir.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The captain, a veteran Guards officer with a pale scar running along his jawline and the ebony skin of the southern Empire, returned the nod with practised formality. &#x201c;Lord Verniers.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I trust you had an untroubled journey?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The captain shrugged. &#x201c;A few threats here and there. Had to crack a few heads in Jesseria, the locals wanted to hang the Hope Killer&#x2019;s carcass from their temple spire.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I bridled at the disloyalty. The Emperor&#x2019;s Edict had been read in all towns through which the prisoner would travel, its meaning plain: no harm will come to the Hope Killer. &#x201c;The Emperor will hear of it,&#x201d; I said.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;As you wish, but it was a small matter.&#x201d; He turned to the prisoner. &#x201c;Lord Verniers, I present the Imperial prisoner Vaelin Al Sorna.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I nodded formally to the tall man, the name a steady refrain in my head.</i> Hope Killer, Hope Killer...<i>&#x201c;Honour to you, sir,&#x201d; I forced the greeting out.</i></p><p><i>His black eyes met mine for a second, piercing, enquiring. For a moment I wondered if the more outlandish stories were true, if there was magic in the gaze of this savage. Could he truly strip the truth from a man&#x2019;s soul? Since the war, stories had abounded of the Hope Killer&#x2019;s mysterious powers. He could talk to animals, command the Nameless and shape the weather to his will. His steel was tempered with the blood of fallen enemies and would never break in battle. And worst of all, he and his people worshipped the dead, communing with the shades of their forebears to conjure forth all manner of foulness. I gave little credence to such folly, reasoning that if the Northmen&#x2019;s magics were so powerful, how had they contrived to suffer such a crushing defeat at our hands?</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;My lord.&#x201d; Vaelin Al Sorna&#x2019;s voice was harsh and thickly accented, his Alpiran had been learned in a dungeon and his tones were no doubt coarsened by years of shouting above the clash of weapons and screams of the fallen to win victory in a hundred battles, one of which had cost me my closest friend and the future of this Empire.</i></p><p><i>I turned to the captain. &#x201c;Why is he shackled? The Emperor ordered he be treated with respect.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;The people didn&#x2019;t like seeing him riding unfettered,&#x201d; the captain explained. &#x201c;The prisoner suggested we shackle him to avoid trouble.&#x201d; He moved to Al Sorna and unlocked the restraints. The big man massaged his wrists with scarred hands.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;My lord!&#x201d; A shout from the crowd. I turned to see a portly man in a white robe hurrying towards us, face wet with unaccustomed exertion. &#x201c;A moment, please!&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The captain&#x2019;s hand inched closer to his sabre but Al Sorna was unconcerned, smiling as the portly man approached. &#x201c;Governor Aruan.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The portly man halted, wiping sweat from his face with a lace scarf. In his left hand he carried a long bundle wrapped in cloth. He nodded at the captain and myself but addressed himself to the prisoner. &#x201c;My lord. I never thought to see you again. Are you well?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I am, Governor. And you?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The portly man spread his right hand, lace scarf dangling from his thumb, jewelled rings on every finger. &#x201c;Governor no longer. Merely a poor merchant these days. Trade is not what it was, but we make our way.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Lord Verniers.&#x201d; Vaelin Al Sorna gestured at me. &#x201c;This is Holus Nester Aruan, former Governor of the City of Linesh.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Honoured Sir.&#x201d; Aruan greeted me with a short bow.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Honoured Sir,&#x201d; I replied formally. So this was the man from whom the Hope Killer had seized the city. Aruan&#x2019;s failure to take his own life in dishonour had been widely remarked upon in the aftermath of the war but the</i> <i>Emperor (Gods preserve him in his wisdom and mercy) had granted clemency in light of the extraordinary circumstances of the Hope Killer&#x2019;s occupation. Clemency, however, had not extended to a continuance of his Governorship.</i></p><p><i>Aruan turned back to Al Sorna. &#x201c;It pleases me to find you well. I wrote to the Emperor begging mercy.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I know, your letter was read at my trial.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I knew from the trial records that Aruan&#x2019;s letter, written at no small risk to his life, had formed part of the evidence describing curiously uncharacteristic acts of generosity and mercy by the Hope Killer during the war. The Emperor had listened patiently to it all before ruling that the prisoner was on trial for his crimes, not his virtues.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Your daughter is well?&#x201d; the prisoner asked Aruan.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Very, she weds this summer. A feckless son of a shipbuilder, but what can a poor father do? Thanks to you, at least she is alive to break my heart.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I am glad. About the wedding, not your broken heart. I can offer no gift except my best wishes.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Actually, my lord, I come with a gift of my own.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Aruan lifted the long, cloth-covered bundle in both hands, presenting it to the Hope Killer with a strangely grave expression. &#x201c;I hear you will have need of this again soon.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>There was a definite hesitation in the Northman&#x2019;s demeanour before he reached out to take the bundle, undoing the ties with his scarred hands. The cloth came away to reveal a sword of unfamiliar design, the scabbard-clad blade was a yard or so in the length and straight, unlike the curved sabres favoured by Alpiran soldiery. A single tine arched around the hilt to form a guard and the only ornamentation to the weapon was a plain steel pommel. The hilt and the scabbard bore many small nicks and scratches that spoke of years of hard use. This was no ceremonial weapon and I realised with a sickening rush that it was</i> his <i>sword. The sword he had carried to our shores. The sword that made him the Hope Killer.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You kept that?&#x201d; I sputtered at Aruan, appalled.</i></p><p><i>The portly man&#x2019;s expression grew cold as he turned to me. &#x201c;My honour demanded no less, my lord.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;My thanks,&#x201d; Al Sorna said, before any further outrage could spill from my lips. He hefted the sword and I saw the Guard Captain stiffen as Al Sorna drew the blade an inch or so from the scabbard, testing the edge with his thumb. &#x201c;Still sharp.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been well cared for. Oiled and sharpened regularly. I also have another small token.&#x201d; Aruan extended his hand. In his palm sat a single ruby, a well-cut stone of medium weight, no doubt one of the more valued gems in the family collection. I knew the story behind Aruan&#x2019;s gratitude, but his evident regard for this savage and the sickening presence of the sword still irked me greatly.</i></p><p><i>Al Sorna seemed at a loss, shaking his head. &#x201c;Governor, I cannot...&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I moved closer, speaking softly. &#x201c;He does you a greater honour than you deserve, Northman. Refusing will insult him and dishonour you.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>He flicked his black eyes over me briefly before smiling at Aruan, &#x201c;I cannot refuse such generosity.&#x201d; He took the gem. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep it always.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I hope not,&#x201d; Aruan responded with a laugh. &#x201c;A man only keeps a jewel when he has no need to sell it.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You there!&#x201d; A voice came from the vessel moored a short distance along the quay, a sizeable Meldenean galley, the number of oars and the width of the hull showing it to be a freighter rather than one of their fabled warships. A stocky man with an extensive black beard, marked as the captain by the red scarf on his head, was waving from the bow. &#x201c;Bring the Hope Killer aboard, you Alpiran dogs!&#x201d; he shouted with customary Meldenean civility. &#x201c;Any more dithering and we&#x2019;ll miss the tide.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Our passage to the Islands awaits,&#x201d; I told the prisoner, gathering my possessions. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d best avoid the ire of our captain.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;So it&#x2019;s true then,&#x201d; Aruan said. &#x201c;You go to the Islands to fight for the lady?&#x201d; I found myself disliking the tone in his voice, it sounded uncomfortably like awe.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s true.&#x201d; He clasped hands briefly with Aruan and nodded at the captain of his guard before turning to me. &#x201c;My lord. Shall we?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You may be one of the first in line to lick your Emperor&#x2019;s feet, scribbler&#x201d;&#x2014;the ship&#x2019;s captain stabbed a finger into my chest&#x2014;&#x201c;but this ship is my kingdom. You berth here or you can spend the voyage roped to the mainmast.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>He had shown us to our quarters, a curtained-off section of the hold near the prow of the ship. The hold stank of brine, bilge water and the intermingled odour of the cargo, a sickly, cloying m�lange of fruit, dried fish and the myriad spices for which the Empire was famous. It was all I could do to keep from gagging.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I am Lord Verniers Alishe Someren, Imperial Chronicler, First of the Learned and honoured servant of the Emperor,&#x201d; I responded, the handkerchief over my mouth muffling my words somewhat. &#x201c;I am emissary to the Ship Lords and official escort to the Imperial prisoner. You will treat me with respect, pirate, or I&#x2019;ll have twenty guardsmen aboard in a trice to flog you in front of your crew.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The captain leaned closer; incredibly his breath smelt worse than the hold. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll have twenty-one bodies to feed to the orcas when we leave the harbour, scribbler.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Al Sorna prodded one of the bedrolls on the deck with his foot and glanced around briefly. &#x201c;This&#x2019;ll do. We&#x2019;ll need food and water.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I bristled. &#x201c;You seriously suggest we sleep in this rat-hole? It&#x2019;s disgusting.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You should try a dungeon. Plenty of rats there too.&#x201d; He turned to the captain. &#x201c;The water barrel is on the foredeck?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The captain ran a stubby finger through the mass of his beard, contemplating the tall man, no doubt wondering if he was being mocked and calculating if he could kill him if he had to. They have a saying on the northern Alpiran coast: turn your back on a cobra but never a Meldenean. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re the one who&#x2019;s going to cross swords with the Shield? They&#x2019;re offering twenty to one against you in Ildera. Think I should risk a copper on you? The Shield is the keenest blade in the Islands, can slice a fly in half with a sabre.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Such renown does him credit.&#x201d; Vaelin Al Sorna smiled. &#x201c;The water barrel?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s there. You can have one gourd a day each, no more. My crew won&#x2019;t go short for the likes of you two. You can get food from the galley, if you don&#x2019;t mind eating with scum like us.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;No doubt I&#x2019;ve eaten with worse. If you need an extra man at the oars, I am at your disposal.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Rowed before have you?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Once.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The captain grunted, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll manage.&#x201d; He turned to go, muttering over his shoulder, &#x201c;We sail within the hour, stay out of the way until we clear the harbour.&#x201d;</i></p></p><h2>Above New York</h2><p>Spectacular views of New York from high above it all.

It depicts the wealth, productivity and complex civilization of the India of the great Mughals and shows how Europeans, including the English, were drawn to its shores, seeking the privilege of trading in its fine muslins, printed cottons and spices. The English East India Company had long insisted on sovereignty within its commercial bases on Indian soil, and a significant body of opinion argued for more secure territorial holdings in the subcontinent. The catalogue attempts to illustrate and analyse the history of India and the British for over 300 years with more than 500 illustrations of the weapons, fabrics, coinage, books, drawings, paintings, prints, sculpture, manuscripts, miniatures, jewellery and maps featured in the exhibition. The book is an illustrated history of India and a contribution both to Indian history and to an understanding of the European experience of colonialism.</p><p>Although this richly illustrated volume catalogues an exhibit held in 1990-1991 at London's National Portrait Gallery, it stands on its own as a study of how the British created images of colonial India, and of how the Indians viewed the British. British artists depicted a "mysterious" subcontinent refracted through European aesthetic categories. Portraits presented Indians as representatives of types, tribes or castes. Indian artists often tried to diminish their foreign overlords, portraying British officials as, at most, the equals of rajas and princes. As nationalism took hold, Indian artists challenged the Raj's depiction of a land fragmented by caste and religion, showing instead Indian unity in diversity.

As minister of the First Baptist Church in Laurel, Mississippi, Charles Marsh&#39;s father Bob Marsh, was a prominent man who was beloved by the community. But Laurel was also home to Sam Bowers, the Imperial Wizard of the White Knights of the Mississippi KKK and the director of their daily, unchallenged installments of terror and misery. Bowers was known and tolerated by the entire white community of Laurel. This included Bob Marsh, who struggled to do the right thing while reeling between righteous indignation and moral torpor, only slowly awakening to fear, suffering, and guilt over his unwillingness to take a public stand against Bowers. At the same time, The Last Days examines the collision of worlds once divided-white Protestant conservatism, the African American struggle for civil rights, and late 1960s counter culture-that propelled the dramatic changes in everyday life in a small Southern town.</p><p><i>The Last Days: A Son's Story of Sin and Segregation at the Dawn of a New South</i> offers a compelling new version of an old story: how good people acquiesce to evil, and then find strength to overcome it. At his best, author Charles Marsh (<i>God's Long Summer</i>) recalls the elegiac prose of Southern writers such as Harper Lee. His memoir begins radiantly: <blockquote>One spring afternoon in 1967, when the warm Alabama air was perfumed with honeysuckle and scuppernong, my father and I were walking along a dirt path through fields of green wiregrass. With his hand brushing lightly against my shoulders, he told me the Lord was calling us to Mississippi, to blessings more abundant than we could ever imagine.</blockquote> In Laurel, Mississippi, Bob Marsh, a prominent Baptist preacher, took the pulpit of a comfortable congregation in a comfortable town where the leading citizens included Sam Bowers, the Imperial Wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Lulled by the luxuries of the good life, Reverend Marsh and his congregation initially believed the civil rights movement was a political matter, not a spiritual one. The slow erosion of their prejudice and dawning of enlightenment is precisely and graciously detailed in <i>The Last Days</i>. The book is also a fine and poignantly humorous evocation of many aspects of daily life in a small Southern town in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In a chapter called "The Joy of Fundamentalist Sex," one of Marsh's classmates pulls a pornographic picture from his wallet at the playground at school, and Marsh gazes on the forbidden fruit uncomprehendingly: "All I could figure was a soupy labyrinth of okra spears and woody knots angling over a blond stew." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Charles Marsh teaches religion at the University of Virginia and is Director of the Project on Lived Theology. He is the author of Reclaiming Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the award-winning God&#39;s Long Summer. He lives in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p><h2>Keep It Simple, Keep It Whole: Your Guide To Optimum Health</h2><p>Keep It Simple, Keep It Whole; is an easy to read book that compiles the essential nutrition and health information you need to obtain optimal health.

The secret is to know when and how to turn on (or turn off) that &#34;bitch switch.&#34; Not being able to locate your &#34;switch&#34; leaves you open to being a victim; not knowing how to turn it off will get you a label that is hard to shake. From Omarosa, reality star, global television personality, and the prime-time woman you love to hate, comes The Bitch Switch, the smart and bitingly honest must-read for every woman who aspires to succeed in relationships, in business, and at home.</p><p>Omarosa has established herself as one of the most recognizable reality stars on television. Omarosa currently has a television series of her own in the works to be produced by Trump and set to air in the fall of 2008.Starred Review. Reality television mainstay Omarosa, best known for her caustic behavior as a contestant on The Apprentice, has embraced her identity as on-screen reality villain and turned it into a genuinely insightful, thorough self-help guide for women looking to strengthen themselves, especially in work environments. Prescribing unapologetic assertiveness in pursuit of one's own happiness, Omarosa wants readers not just to find their "inner bitch," but learn to control it via the "bitch switch." Her advice for deploying the bitch is simple and straightforward, presented with surprising respect and fairness; Omarosa's overbearing self-involvement, in this book, becomes a studied strategy in avoiding exploitation. Lots of Omarosa's advice is old and faithful-the importance of self-esteem, the negligibility of what others think of you-but she has an aggressive, involving style, a definite point of view, and no trouble explaining either in succinct lessons and anecdotes, with plenty of sidebars ("What Would Omarosa Do?"), self-evaluations and exercises. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ethan tells Savannah that his wife, Beth, stormed out of their Malibu house after the couple had an argument the day before, accompanied by their toddler son and the boy's nanny, Pilar Padila. Ethan admits Beth has temporarily left him before in such circumstances, but she always kept in touch. That he hasn't heard from her in more than 24 hours has him worried. When Pilar is found brutally murdered, Savannah's hubby, San Carmelita, Calif., Det. Sgt. Dirk Coulter, joins the case.

The time is World War II. Young soldier Ira &#x201c;Teen&#x201d; Palm and his men burst into a Munich apartment, hoping to capture Adolph Hitler. Instead, they find an empty apartment ... and a golden gun. As the authors trace the story of the man and the gun, they examine a time and place that shaped men like Palm and transformed them into heroes. They also follow the strange journey of Hitler&#x2019;s pistol. Readers will discover: � An imaginative historical adventure in the tradition of Stephen Ambrose&#x2019;s Band of Brothers (over one million copies sold). � New, previously untold information about World War II events, including an uprising of German soldiers and citizens against the Nazi regime and a never-before told account of an assassination attempt on Hitler in Munich. � Inspiring, motivating, and entertaining storytelling by award-winning authors that will keep the pages turning!</p></p><p>Maurice Possley is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who is a Research Fellow at the Santa Clara University School of Law&#x2019;s Northern California Innocence Project.

He is the editor of Great Leaders of the Christian Church and coeditor of works including The Mark of Jesus. Woodbridge is the recipient of four Gold Medallion Awards.When young Ira 'Teen' Palm goes off to fight against Hitler and the invading German armies, he has little to shore up his courage apart from his faith in God and his intense patriotism. Both would play an enormous role in his lengthy career in the armed forces, but they would particularly direct his actions as he fights in a foreign land against a brutal and determined dictator. After the war, Palm's mentor, the Rev. Charles Woodbridge, is the recipient of an unusual gift -- a 'golden pistol given to Hitler by the Walther family' -- taken by Palm as a grisly souvenir of the Fuehrer's armory. John Woodbridge, son of Charles, knows there's a fascinating story to be told. He and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Possley (The Brown's Chicken Massacre) lead readers through a tale brimming with exciting accounts of people risking all in the name of God and freedom. Taking us through the wartime challenges Palm and his wife, Helen, face, this fast-paced story reminds us that ordinary people can do extraordinary things, even under great pressure, when fueled by God's amazing grace.

The son of an African<br> American father and a Dominican mother, Randall obsesses over lineage and legacy, both biological ties<br> between people and the lives of exceptional individuals. In "Portrait of My Father as Sisyphus," the<br> speaker depicts a man who must care for his ailing mother and who, like Sisyphus, will bear this difficult<br> burden until one of them perishes. Elsewhere, Randall depicts the only black boy in a cold Nebraska<br> classroom who is subjected to "the savage lick of a whip as a means of explaining an entire history." A<br> native Chicagoan, Randall weaves President Obama throughout the book, drawing on shared experiences<br> of biracial black men, but closes the series at a vital crossroads with a Langston Hughes homage: "Obama<br> Speaks of Rivers but We Have Always Been on Different Shores." Throughout, <b>Randall is a master of<br> simple, unexpectedly devastating lyrics</b>: "sometimes being Biracial / is to have two half-filled gasses /<br> &amp; die of thirst anyway."

As we contemplate how to go forward in an America whose fault line runs deep, an immigrant son entrenched in the American experience, a black man owning his Dominican heritage, a sensualist uncowed by the magnetic poles of sexual appeals, a poet unabashedly forwards, interrogates, and illumines the fulsome measure of his &#x2018;I&#x2019; . . .

That&#x2019;s what I said.&#x201d; His valet, Tom Byrd, face carefully averted, put the lid back on the pot. &#x201c;Was you to rub yourself with&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>stuff, you&#x2019;d be drawing flies in their hundreds, same as if you were summat&nbsp;that was dead.&nbsp;<i>Long</i>&nbsp;dead,&#x201d; he added, and muffled the pot in a napkin for&nbsp;additional protection.<br>&#x201c;Well, in justice,&#x201d; Grey said dubiously, &#x201c;I suppose the whale&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;long&nbsp;dead.&#x201d; He looked at the far wall of his office. There were a number of flies&nbsp;resting along the wainscoting, as usual, fat and black as currants against&nbsp;the white plaster. Sure enough, a couple of them had already risen into the&nbsp;air, circling lazily toward the pot of whale oil. &#x201c;Where did you get that&nbsp;stuff?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The owner of the Moor&#x2019;s Head keeps a keg of it; he burns it in his&nbsp;lamps&#x2014;cheaper&nbsp;nor even tallow candles, he says, let alone proper wax&nbsp;ones.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ah. I daresay.&#x201d; Given the usual smell of the Moor&#x2019;s Head on a busy&nbsp;night, nobody would notice the stink of whale oil above the symphony of&nbsp;other reeks.<br><br> &#x201c;Easier to come by on Jamaica than bear grease, I reckon,&#x201d; Tom remarked,&nbsp;picking up the pot. &#x201c;D&#x2019;you want me to try it with the mint, me&nbsp;lord? It&nbsp;<i>might</i>&nbsp;help,&#x201d; he added, with a dubious wrinkle of the nose.<br>Tom had automatically picked up the oily rag that lived on the corner&nbsp;of Grey&#x2019;s desk and, with a dexterous flick, snapped a fat fly out of the air&nbsp;and into oblivion.<br><br> &#x201c;Dead whale garnished with mint? That should cause my blood to be&nbsp;especially attractive to the more discriminating biting insects in Charles&nbsp;Town&#x2014;to&nbsp;say nothing of Canada.&#x201d; Jamaican flies were a nuisance but&nbsp;seldom carnivorous, and the sea breeze and muslin window screening kept&nbsp;most mosquitoes at bay. The swamps of coastal America, though . . . and&nbsp;the deep Canadian woods, his ultimate destination . . .<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Grey said reluctantly, scratching his neck at the mere thought of&nbsp;Canadian deer flies. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t attend Mr. Mullryne&#x2019;s celebration of his new plantation house basted in whale oil. Perhaps we can get bear grease in&nbsp;South Carolina. Meanwhile . . . sweet oil, perhaps?&#x201d;<br><br> Tom shook his head decidedly.<br><br> &#x201c;No, me lord. Azeel says sweet oil draws spiders. They come and lick it&nbsp;off your skin whilst you&#x2019;re asleep.&#x201d;<br><br> Lord John and his valet shuddered simultaneously, recollecting last&nbsp;week&#x2019;s experience with a banana spider&#x2014;a&nbsp;creature with a leg span the size&nbsp;of a child&#x2019;s hand&#x2014;that&nbsp;had burst unexpectedly out of a ripe banana, followed&nbsp;by what appeared at the time to be several hundred small offspring,&nbsp;at a garden party given by Grey to mark his departure from the island and&nbsp;to welcome the Honorable Mr. Houghton Braythwaite, his successor as&nbsp;governor.<br><br> &#x201c;I thought he&#x2019;d have an apoplexy on the spot,&#x201d; Grey said, lips twitching.<br><br> &#x201c;Likely wishes he had.&#x201d;<br><br> Grey looked at Tom, Tom at Grey, and they burst into suffocated snorts&nbsp;of laughter at the memory of the Honorable Mr. Braythwaite&#x2019;s face on&nbsp;this occasion.<br><br> &#x201c;Come, come,&#x201d; Lord John said, getting himself under control. &#x201c;This&nbsp;will never do. Have you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> The rumble of a carriage coming up the gravel drive of King&#x2019;s House&nbsp;interrupted him.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, God, is that him now?&#x201d; Grey glanced guiltily round at the disarray&nbsp;of his office: A gaping half-packed&nbsp;portmanteau lolled in the corner,&nbsp;and the desk was strewn with scattered documents and the remnants of&nbsp;lunch, in no condition to be viewed by the man who would inherit it&nbsp;tomorrow. &#x201c;Run out and distract him, will you, Tom? Take him to the&nbsp;receiving room and pour rum into him. I&#x2019;ll come and fetch him as soon as&nbsp;I&#x2019;ve done . . . something . . . about this.&#x201d; He waved a hand at the debris,&nbsp;and Tom obligingly vanished.<br><br> Grey picked up the oiled rag and disposed of an unwary fly, then seized&nbsp;a plate scattered with bread crusts, blobs of custard, and fruit peelings and&nbsp;decanted this out of the window into the garden beneath. Thrusting the&nbsp;empty plate out of sight under the desk, he began hurriedly to gather papers&nbsp;into piles but was interrupted almost at once by the reappearance of&nbsp;Tom, looking excited.<br><br> &#x201c;Me lord! It&#x2019;s General Stanley!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Who?&#x201d; Grey said blankly. His mind, occupied with the details of imminent&nbsp;escape, refused to deal with anything that might interfere with said&nbsp;escape, but &#x201c;Stanley&#x201d; did ring a distant, small bell.<br><br> &#x201c;Might be as he&#x2019;s your mother&#x2019;s husband, me lord?&#x201d; Tom said, with a&nbsp;becoming diffidence.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh . . . that General Stanley. Why didn&#x2019;t you say so?&#x201d; John hastily&nbsp;grabbed his coat from its hook and shrugged into it, brushing crumbs off&nbsp;his waistcoat as he did so. &#x201c;Show him in, by all means!&#x201d;<br><br> John in fact liked his mother&#x2019;s third husband&#x2014;she&nbsp;having been twice&nbsp;widowed when she acquired the general four years before&#x2014;though&nbsp;any&nbsp;military intrusion at this point was something to be regarded warily.<br><br> Wariness was, as usual, justified. The General Stanley who eventually&nbsp;appeared was not the bluff, jaunty, self-confident&nbsp;man last seen in his&nbsp;mother&#x2019;s company. This General Stanley was hobbling with a stick, his&nbsp;right foot bound up in an immense bandage, and his face gray with pain,&nbsp;effort . . . and profound anxiety.<br><br> &#x201c;General!&#x201d; John seized him by the arm before he could fall over and&nbsp;guided him to the nearest chair, hastily removing a pile of maps from it.&nbsp;&#x201c;Do sit down, please&#x2014;Tom,&nbsp;would you . . . ?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Just here, me lord.&#x201d; Tom had dug Grey&#x2019;s flask out of the open traveling&nbsp;bag with commendable promptitude and now thrust it into General&nbsp;Stanley&#x2019;s hand.<br><br> The general accepted this without question and drank deeply.<br><br> &#x201c;Dear Lord,&#x201d; he said, setting the flask on his knee and breathing heavily. &#x201c;I thought I shouldn&#x2019;t make it from the landing.&#x201d; He took another&nbsp;drink, somewhat more slowly, eyes closed.<br><br> &#x201c;More brandy, Tom, if you please?&#x201d; Grey said, watching this. Tom gave&nbsp;the general an assessing look, not sure whether he might die before more&nbsp;brandy could be fetched, but decided to bet on the general&#x2019;s survival and&nbsp;disappeared in search of sustenance.<br><br> &#x201c;God.&#x201d; The general looked a good deal short of human but distinctly&nbsp;better than he had. He nodded thanks to John and handed back the empty&nbsp;flask with a trembling hand. &#x201c;The doctor says I mustn&#x2019;t drink wine&#x2014;apparently it&#x2019;s bad for the gout&#x2014;but&nbsp;I don&#x2019;t recall his mentioning brandy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; John said, glancing at the bandaged foot. &#x201c;Did he say anything&nbsp;about rum?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not a word.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Excellent. I&#x2019;m down to my last bottle of French brandy, but we&#x2019;ve got&nbsp;quite a lot of rum.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Bring the cask.&#x201d; The general was beginning to show a tinge of color&nbsp;and, at this point, began to be cognizant of his surroundings. &#x201c;You were&nbsp;packing to leave?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I am packing to leave, yes,&#x201d; John said, the feeling of wariness developing small, prickling feet inside his stomach. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m meant to sail tonight, for&nbsp;Charles Town.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Thank God. I was afraid I shouldn&#x2019;t make it in time.&#x201d; The general&nbsp;breathed audibly for a moment, then gathered himself. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your mother.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;<i>What&#x2019;s</i>&nbsp;my mother?&#x201d; The wariness turned instantly to a flare of alarm.&nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened to her?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Nothing, yet. Or at least I sincerely hope not.&#x201d; The general patted the&nbsp;air in a vague gesture of reassurance that failed singularly to reassure.<br><br> &#x201c;Where the devil is she? And what in God&#x2019;s name is she up to now?&#x201d;&nbsp;Grey spoke with more heat than filial respect, but panic made him edgy.<br><br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s in Havana,&#x201d; General Stanley said. &#x201c;Minding your cousin Olivia.&#x201d;<br><br> This seemed like a moderately respectable thing for an elderly lady to be&nbsp;doing, and Grey relaxed slightly. But only slightly.<br><br> &#x201c;Is she ill?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br> &#x201c;I hope not. She said in her last letter that there was an outbreak of&nbsp;some sort of ague in the city, but she herself was in good health.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; Tom had come back with the brandy bottle, and John poured&nbsp;himself a small glass. &#x201c;I trust she&#x2019;s enjoying the weather.&#x201d; He raised an&nbsp;eyebrow at his stepfather, who sighed deeply and put his hands on his&nbsp;knees.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure she is. The problem, my boy, is that the British Navy is on its&nbsp;way to lay siege to the city of Havana, and I really think it would be a good&nbsp;idea if your mother wasn&#x2019;t in the city when they get there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> For a moment, John stood frozen, glass in hand, mouth open,&nbsp;and his brain so congested with questions that he was unable to articulate&nbsp;any of them. At last, he gulped the remains of his drink, coughed, and said&nbsp;mildly, &#x201c;Oh, I see. How does my mother come to be in Havana to start&nbsp;with?&#x201d;<br><br> The general leaned back and let out a long breath.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all the fault of that Stubbs fellow.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Stubbs . . . ?&#x201d; It sounded vaguely familiar, but stunned as he was, Grey couldn&#x2019;t think why.<br><br> &#x201c;You know, chap who married your cousin Olivia. Looks like a builder&#x2019;s&nbsp;brick. What&#x2019;s his Christian name . . . Matthew? No, Malcolm, that&#x2019;s it. Malcolm Stubbs.&#x201d;<br><br> Grey reached for the brandy bottle, but Tom was already pouring a&nbsp;fresh glass, which he thrust into his employer&#x2019;s hand. He carefully avoided&nbsp;meeting Grey&#x2019;s eye.<br><br> &#x201c;Malcolm Stubbs.&#x201d; Grey sipped brandy, to give himself time to think.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, of course. I . . . take it that he&#x2019;s quite recovered, then?&#x201d; On one&nbsp;level, this was good news; Malcolm Stubbs had lost a foot and part of the&nbsp;adjoining leg to a cannonball at the Battle of Quebec, more than two years&nbsp;before. By good luck, Grey had fallen over him on the field and had the&nbsp;presence of mind to use his belt as a tourniquet, thus preventing Stubbs&nbsp;from bleeding to death. He vividly recalled the splintered bone protruding&nbsp;from the remnants of Malcolm&#x2019;s shin, and the hot, wet smell of blood&nbsp;and shit, steaming in the cold air. He took a deeper swallow of brandy.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, quite. Got an artificial foot, gets around quite well&#x2014;even&nbsp;rides.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good for him,&#x201d; Grey said, rather shortly. There were a few other&nbsp;things he recalled about Malcolm Stubbs. &#x201c;Is&nbsp;<i>he</i>&nbsp;in Havana?&#x201d;<br><br> The general looked surprised.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, didn&#x2019;t I say? He&#x2019;s a diplomat of some kind now&#x2014;sent&nbsp;to Havana&nbsp;last September.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A diplomat,&#x201d; Grey repeated. &#x201c;Well, well.&#x201d; Stubbs probably did diplomacy&nbsp;well&#x2014;given&nbsp;his demonstrated skills at lying, deceit, and dishonor. . . .<br><br> &#x201c;He wanted his wife and children to join him in Havana, once he had&nbsp;a suitable establishment, so&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Children? He had <br>only the one son when I last saw him.&#x201d; Only the one&nbsp;legitimate son, he added silently.<br><br> &#x201c;Two, now&#x2014;Olivia&nbsp;gave birth to a daughter two years ago; lovely child&nbsp;called Charlotte.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How nice.&#x201d; His memory of the birth of Olivia&#x2019;s first child, Cromwell,&nbsp;was nearly as horrifyingly vivid as his memories of the Battle of Quebec, if&nbsp;for somewhat different reasons. Both had involved blood and shit, though.<br><br> &#x201c;But Mother&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Your mother offered to accompany Olivia, to help with the children.&nbsp;Olivia&#x2019;s expecting again, and a long sea voyage . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Again?&#x201d; Well, it wasn&#x2019;t as though Grey didn&#x2019;t know what Stubbs&#x2019;s attitude&nbsp;toward sex was . . . and at least the man was doing it with his wife.&nbsp;John kept his temper with some difficulty, but the general didn&#x2019;t notice,&nbsp;continuing with his explanations.<br><br> &#x201c;You see, I was meant to be sailing to Savannah in the spring&#x2014;now,&nbsp;I&nbsp;mean&#x2014;to&nbsp;advise a Colonel Folliott, who&#x2019;s raising a local militia to assist&nbsp;the governor, and your mother was going to come with me. So it seemed&nbsp;reasonable that she go ahead with Olivia and help her to get settled, and I&nbsp;would arrange for her to join me when I came.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Very sensible,&#x201d; John said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Mother, then. And where does the&nbsp;British Navy come into it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Admiral Holmes, me lord,&#x201d; Tom said, with a faint air of reproach.&nbsp;&#x201c;He told you last week, when you had him to dinner. He said the Duke of&nbsp;Albemarle was a-coming&nbsp;to take Martinique away from the frogs and then&nbsp;see to Cuba.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh. Ah.&#x201d;<br><br> Grey recalled the dinner, which had featured a remarkable dish that he had realized&#x2014;too&nbsp;late&#x2014;was&nbsp;the innards of pickled sea urchins, mixed with bits of raw fish and sea lettuce that had been cured with orange juice. In his desire to keep his guests&#x2014;all&nbsp;recently arrived from London, and all lamenting the dearth of roast beef and potatoes in the Indies&#x2014;from&nbsp;sharing&nbsp;his realization, he had called for lavish and repeated applications of a native palm liquor. This had been very effective; by the second glass, they wouldn&#x2019;t have known they were eating whale turds, should his adventurous&nbsp;cook have taken it into his head to serve that as a second course. Consequently, though, his own memories of the occasion were somewhat dim.<br><br> &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t say Albemarle was proposing to lay siege to the place, did&nbsp;he?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, me lord, but that must&#x2019;ve been his meaning, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;God knows,&#x201d; said John, who knew nothing about Cuba, Havana, or&nbsp;the Duke of Albemarle. &#x201c;Or possibly you do, sir?&#x201d; He turned politely to&nbsp;General Stanley, who was beginning to look better, under the influence of&nbsp;relief and brandy. The general nodded.<br><br> &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he admitted frankly, &#x201c;save that I shared Albemarle&#x2019;s table&nbsp;aboard his flagship for six weeks. What I don&#x2019;t presently know about the&nbsp;harbor at Havana probably isn&#x2019;t worth knowing, but I take no credit for&nbsp;the acquisition of that knowledge.&#x201d;<br><br> The general had learned of Albemarle&#x2019;s expedition only the night before the fleet sailed, when a message from the War Office had reached him,&nbsp;ordering him aboard.<br><br> &#x201c;At that point, of course, the ship would reach Cuba long before any message I could send to your mother, so I went aboard at once&#x2014;this&#x201d;&#x2014;&nbsp;he&nbsp;glowered at his &nbsp;bandaged foot&#x2014;&#x201c;&nbsp;notwithstanding.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Quite.&#x201d; John raised a hand in brief interruption and turned to his&nbsp;valet. &#x201c;Tom,&#x2014;run&#x2014;and&nbsp;I do mean&nbsp;<i>run</i>&#x2014;to&nbsp;Admiral Holmes&#x2019;s residence&nbsp;and ask him to call upon me as soon as is convenient. And by convenient,&nbsp;I mean&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Right now. Yes, me lord.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Thank you, Tom.&#x201d;<br><br> Despite the brandy, Grey&#x2019;s brain had finally grasped the situation and&nbsp;was busy calculating what to do about it.<br><br> If the British Navy showed up in Havana Harbor and started shelling&nbsp;the place, it wasn&#x2019;t merely physical danger threatening the Stubbs family&nbsp;and Lady Stanley, also known as the Dowager Duchess of Pardloe.

Even common applications make NEC training essential. For example, consider those tables in Article 310. Do you really understand how to size conductors? Do you understand when to use the 90 degree column and when not to? Do you know when to use Table 310.17 rather than 310.16, or 310.19 rather than 310.17? How do you apply these tables when sizing feeders for motor circuits? What about motor branch circuits? A wrong answer to any of these questions can be costly. Some highlights of what you will understand after using this outstanding resource: Article 90. Know the purpose and scope of the NEC, and understand how it&#39;s arranged so you can quickly find what you need. Chapter 1. Become familiar with the general requirements that apply to all installations. You&#39;ll understand NEC terminology, which wiring methods are suitable, and the truth about space requirements. Chapter 2. Know the requirements for neutrals, branch circuits, feeders, outside wiring, and services. You&#39;ll obtain competence and confidence in sizing and applying circuit protection. You&#39;ll also understand how grounding and bonding differ, and how to apply the concepts properly in the real world. Chapter 3. Don&#39;t run afoul of the requirements for conductors, enclosures, fittings, cable assemblies and raceways. Do you know how the rules for EMT differ from those for RMC? What about armored cable? Which conductor is right for the job? Chapter 4. Cords, switches, receptacles, panelboards, and lighting are just some of the Chapter 4 topics you must understand to avoid code violations. Don&#39;t let Article 430-the largest of the NEC Articles-be a &#34;motor mystery&#34; to you. And don&#39;t let the rules for generators, transformers, or capacitors continue to confuse you.</p><p></p><h2>Mending Places</h2><p>Hanna can forgive anything. But can she forgive this?

(Oh, wait. Maybe we do.) But Lindsay Bach, the main narrator of Andrea Bartz's hypnotic <em>The Lost Night</em>, is cut from a different cloth. She's never doubted she was at a concert the night her best friend, Edie, committed suicide ten years ago&#x2014;at least until another friend states just as unequivocally that Lindsay never arrived. Now Edie's "suicide" is questionable as well, as Lindsay unearths a rats' nest of secrets but finds just as many holes in her own memory. As Lindsay assembles old Facebook photos, conversations with former friends, shaky memories, and an equally shaky handheld video recording, the truth of that night draws closer, even as Lindsay wonders if she can handle knowing what really happened. Bartz drops enough hints that some readers will pat themselves on the backs for spotting the big reveal, while others will gasp. As Brooklyn's drug-fueled hipster scene transmutes between glorious and grimy, nostalgic and toxic, Bartz's debut thriller achieves a complex, murky depth perfectly designed to hide the facts Lindsay so desperately desires and fears. <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang, Amazon Book Review</em>ANDREA BARTZ is a Brooklyn-based journalist, author of the thriller <i>The Lost Night</i>, and coauthor of the blog-turned-book <i>Stuff Hipsters Hate</i>, which <i>The New Yorker</i> called "depressingly astute."

From that fateful radioactive bite in the science hall up to Spidey 2099, DK's <i>Ultimate Guide</i> recounts all the career milestones--major and minor--of Stan Lee's web-slinging wall-crawler. Organized and authored by Tom DeFalco, former Marvel editor in chief and the series' bestselling author, this guide pulls together the storyline's many twists and turns (chronologically, by decade) and devotes big spreads to nearly every noteworthy ally, friend, and villain (with one curious omission in the Shocker). Special sections cover episodes like the alien costume, the regrettable clone saga, and the wedding to Mary Jane, while panel after panel of original art (over 600 images in all) flesh out the action (a particular treat with the corny old dialogue and art).<p> DeFalco makes some small missteps--inevitable in any fan-boy project--and certainly <i>The Ultimate Guide</i> will feel dated as the series evolves, but as a comprehensive guide, it just doesn't get any better.

Ivan, a young Jewish boy from Milwaukee, embarks on a journey of sexual discovery that leads him from Wisconsin to Alaska, Philadelphia, and Mexico through stints as a fishery worker, artist, and finally a hustler who learns to provide the blank canvas for other people&#x2019;s dreams. The result is a new kind of coming-of-age story that sees passion from every angle because its protagonist is every kind of lover: the seducer and the seduced, the pornographer and the model, the hunter and the prey, the trick and the john. In the end, <i>Setting the Lawn on Fire</i> is also something rare&#x2014;a fully realized, contemporary romance that illuminates the power of desire and the rituals of the body, the brain, and the heart that attempt to contain our passions.</p></p><p>Mack Friedman is the author of <i>Strapped for Cash: A History of American Hustler Culture</i>.

We meet Friedman's character in the chaotic impulses of early childhood, watch him gallop through the frustrated yearnings of adolescence and early manhood, and see him sacrificed to lust, adventure, and the market for sex. What finally emerges is a full-fledged human identity, the unmistakable proof that existence equals desire. Everything in this book is tinged with it, from the light on an Alaskan plain to sweat trickling across taut young skin. Friedman has discovered the magic link between libido and humanity, arousal and our taste for living, and he shares this with us elegantly, never losing his honesty, humility and respect for others."&#x2014;Bruce Benderson, author of <i>The Romanian: Story of an Obsession</i> and winner of France's Prix de Flore 2004</p><br><br><p>"Who would have thought there were still stories about coming of age and coming out that were waiting to be told in America?

Rather than looking back toward antiquarian knowledge, Franklin set his college's course toward the world of the present and the future by focusing on modern languages, the natural sciences, and contemporary literature. His goals were soon reflected in the addition of a course in medicine, the first in the New World, and, by the end of the century, a course in law. This broader definition of education was celebrated after the American Revolution when the College was renamed the University of Pennsylvania, the first American institution to carry that all-encompassing title. In the intervening centuries, Franklin's vision has become the model of American higher education.</p><p>Since its founding the University has adapted to reflect the values of the community that has supported it, charting a course between innovation and convention. These changes are evident in the architecture and character of the three campuses that have been its home. From Franklin's adaptation of a nonsectarian chapel as the institution's first quarters to Frank Furness's innovative University Library and Louis Kahn's momentous Richards Medical Research Laboratory, Penn's buildings can be seen as illuminating the evolving intentions of the University's leaders.</p><p>Written by architectural historians George E. Thomas and David B. Brownlee, <i>Building America's First University</i> uses the physical evidence of Penn's campuses and buildings to illustrate the development of this landmark institution in American education. Part 1 recounts the history of the University, with three of the five chapters devoted to the evolution of the current campus. The historical chapters weave together the often conflicting interests and goals of trustees, administrators, alumni, and students that have shaped the institution of today. Part 2 presents a gazetteer to the campus in its present form&#x2014;two hundred and fifty years after Benjamin Franklin wrote his "Proposals for the Education of Youth in Pensilvania." Here the authors describe every significant building on campus, with at least one photograph of each. Coming at the end of forty years of massive growth, this is the first comprehensive architectural history of the University since the early twentieth century.</p></p><p>George E. Thomas is Lecturer of Historical Preservation and Urban Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of Frank Furness: The Complete Works and William L.

Other notable works include&nbsp;<i>Mermaid Saga, Rumic Theater, </i>and<i> One-Pound Gospel.</i><br> <br>Takahashi won the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award twice in her career, once for&nbsp;<i>Urusei Yatsura</i>&nbsp;in 1981 and the second time for <i>Inuyasha </i>in 2002. A majority of the Takahashi canon has been adapted into other media such as anime, live-action TV series, and film.&nbsp;Takahashi's manga, as well as the other formats her work has been adapted into, have continued to delight generations of fans around the world. Distinguished by her wonderfully endearing characters, Takahashi's work adeptly incorporates a wide variety of elements such as comedy, romance, fantasy, and martial arts. While her series are difficult to pin down into one simple genre, the signature style she has created has come to be known as the "Rumic World."

Then Jinx the cat is implicated, and Freddy&#39;s skills are really tested. Age 6+</p><p>"Oh, I am the King of Detectives, / And when I am out on the trail / All the animal criminals tremble, / And the criminal animals quail..." boasts Freddy, the poetry-prone, Sherlock Holmes-obsessed pig who stars in Walter R. Brooks's beloved series. From 1927 to 1958, Brooks wrote 26 Freddy books--including <i>Freddy Goes to Florida</i>--all focused on the well-rounded pig, who has been described by various fans as ingenious, intelligent, loyal, and resourceful. Since Brooks's books fell out of print, librarians across the country have scrounged up copies wherever possible, even resorting to photocopying the books and binding them with hockey-stick tape! To the delight of thousands, the fabulous Freddy books have been reprinted by Overlook Press!<p> The intrigue of <i>Freddy the Detective</i> begins on the Bean Farm (Freddy's upstate New York abode), when a toy train is discovered missing from young Everett Bean's room. Freddy jumps at the chance to prove his sleuth skills: "I'll find that train, you bet! There are a lot of mysteries on a farm like this and I'll solve 'em all!" he proclaims. The pig can't gracefully outfox the rats (and they sing derisive songs about him), but eventually he does solve cases from "The Mystery of Egbert" (about a bunny who'd wandered off from his family) to "The Case of Prinny's Dinner" (about a white woolly dog's missing food). The shenanigans all sound innocent enough, but Brooks is hilariously tongue-in-cheek; his insightful descriptions of animal characters are always compassionate; and his subtle appeal to a child's instinct for justice is no less than masterful. As Adam Hochschild of the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> writes, "The moral center of my childhood universe, the place where good and evil, friendship and treachery, honesty and humbug were defined most clearly, was not church, not school, and not the Boy Scouts. It was the Bean Farm." Welcome back, Freddy! (Ages 9 to 12, but great for reading aloud to younger children.) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Walter R. Brooks&nbsp;was an American writer best remembered for his short stories on&nbsp;Mister Ed&nbsp;the talking horse and children's books, particularly those about&nbsp;Freddy the Pig&nbsp;and other anthropomorphic animal inhabitants of the "Bean farm" in&nbsp;upstate New York.<br><br> Kurt Wiese illustrated over 400 books, nineteen of which he also wrote, before his death in 1974.</p><h2>The Long Gaze Back: An Anthology of Irish Women Writers</h2><p>Dublin&#39;s One City, One Book Choice for 2018. The Long Gaze Back, edited by Sinad Gleeson, is an exhilarating anthology of thirty short stories by some of the most gifted women writers this island has ever produced. Taken together, the collected works of these writers reveal an enrapturing, unnerving, and piercingly beautiful mosaic of a lively literary landscape. Spanning four centuries, The Long Gaze Back features 8 rare stories from deceased luminaries and forerunners, and 22 new unpublished stories by some of the most talented Irish women writers working today. The anthology presents an inclusive and celebratory portrait of the high calibre of contemporary literature in Ireland. These stories run the gamut from heartbreaking to humorous, but each leaves a lasting impression. They chart the passions, obligations, trials and tribulations of a variety of vividly-drawn characters with unflinching honesty and relentless compassion. These are stories to savour.</p><p></p><h2>Writing Indian Nations: Native Intellectuals and the Politics of Historiography, 1827-1863</h2><p>In the early years of the republic, the United States government negotiated with Indian nations because it could not afford protracted wars politically, militarily, or economically. Maureen Konkle argues that by depending on treaties, which rest on the equal standing of all signatories, Europeans in North America institutionalized a paradox: the very documents through which they sought to dispossess Native peoples in fact conceded Native autonomy. <br><br>As the United States used coerced treaties to remove Native peoples from their lands, a group of Cherokee, Pequot, Ojibwe, Tuscarora, and Seneca writers spoke out. With history, polemic, and personal narrative these writers countered widespread misrepresentations about Native peoples' supposedly primitive nature, their inherent inability to form governments, and their impending disappearance. Furthermore, they contended that arguments about racial difference merely justified oppression and dispossession; deriding these arguments as willful attempts to evade the true meanings and implications of the treaties, the writers insisted on recognition of Native peoples' political autonomy and human equality. Konkle demonstrates that these struggles over the meaning of U.S.-Native treaties in the early nineteenth century led to the emergence of the first substantial body of Native writing in English and, as she shows, the effects of the struggle over the political status of Native peoples remain embedded in contemporary scholarship.<br><br></p><p>"An important contribution to the scholarship on nineteenth-century Native literature."-- <i>Early American Literature</i> <br>Maureen Konkle is associate professor of English at the University of Missouri-Columbia.</p><h2>Heart of Winter: An Anthology</h2><p><b><i>Woman Hater</i></b><br><br>Everyone in the office described the boss's mysterious older brother as wary of the female of the species&#x2014;a real woman hater. He'd been burned in the past, and now was twice shy, to say the least. So when Nicole White had to travel with her ailing employer to his brother's home in Montana, she was prepared for the worst.<br>What she found was a man more roughly masculine than any she'd ever met.<br>But Winthrop Christopher's distrust of women ran straight to the bone.

Rumor had it the popular politician was an embezzler. It was just a rumor, Carla told herself. As a reporter she'd have to get to the bottom of it; as a woman, she wanted nothing more than to lose herself in sexy Mayor Moreland's arms. Or was that exactly where he wanted her, for reasons other than love and seduction?</p><p>The prolific author of more than one hundred books, Diana Palmer got her start as a newspaper reporter. A New York Times bestselling author and voted one of the top ten romance writers in America, she has a gift for telling the most sensual tales with charm and humor. Diana lives with her family in Cornelia, Georgia.When Gerald Christopher first suggested going to his family ranch in Montana to rest his recently diagnosed ulcer for a few weeks, Nicole had instant reservations. He was the boss, of course, and if he wanted to go to Montana, there was no reason he shouldn't. But Nicole liked the pleasant routine of life in Chicago, where she'd spent the last two years working for the Christopher Corporation. At twenty-two, Nicole White had found a nice, pleasant rut for herself and she didn't particularly like change.<p> </p><p>The problem was that if Mr. Christopher went to Montana for a month, as he was threatening, and closed down his personal office while he was gone, Nicole would be out of a job until his return. Despite her adequate wages, trying to live for a month without any salary was a frightening thought. That was almost laughable considering her background, because Nicole's family had been one of the old moneyed ones of Kentucky. Her father, in fact, was still one of the jet set, a noted sportsman as well as a horse-racing magnate, and lived the part. Nicole had long since renounced her share of the family fortune and gone to work for a living.</p><p> </p><p>Her mother's death had been the last straw. Her father had been with his latest mistress at the time, not that he'd ever been home a lot. That hadn't mattered at the time, because Nicole had been sure that her new fianc�, Chase James, would set up their marriage and that his job as a real estate agent would make it possible for him to support the two of them. She'd figured wrong. Once Chase found out that Nicole had been foolish enough to give up her family fortune--and when he realized that she couldn't possibly be talked out of it--he asked for his ring back. His immediate defection to one of Nicole's moneyed and eligible girlfriends had shattered her young life.</p><p> </p><p>At the age of twenty, she'd left the elegant brick mansion of her childhood in Lexington, Kentucky, and a racehorse farm worth millions, to live the frugal life as a secretary in Chicago, where she had a friend with whom she could room. She smiled, remembering her lack of skills at the time, and how patient Mr. Christopher had been until she'd crammed in some courses at the local secretarial school. Lucky for her that he'd liked her personality and had decided to take a chance on her secretarial skills improving. They had. She'd graduated from the course at the top of her class.</p><p> </p><p>It all seemed a long time ago now, a part of her life that was like some slowly fading photograph of a reality she no longer belonged to....</p><p> </p><p>"You'll like it there, Nicky," Gerald Christopher said dreamily, staring out the window. "The ranch is in the southern part of the state, nestled in the Rocky Mountains. It's rich with forests, lakes, rivers, peace and quiet. Just the thing to help me get over this ulcer they've diagnosed. We can work in peace and you can have plenty of free time to yourself."</p><p> </p><p>"But your brother and his family--won't they mind having your secretary to house and feed?" she asked, her pale green eyes hesitant in a plain but interesting oval face, surrounded by naturally curling short dark hair. Despite the fact that she'd worked for him for two years, she knew very little about his private life. He'd never made a habit of talking casually about anything personal, as some employers did. She knew he had a brother, and he'd mentioned a woman named Mary, whom she'd assumed was his sister-in-law. But that was really all she knew about him in any personal way.</p><p> </p><p>"Winthrop doesn't have a family," he said, smiling as he turned toward her. He was tall with brown hair and dark brown eyes. Not a bad-looking man and he seemed pleasant enough, but he wasn't a woman chaser or a ladies' man. He was very businesslike and a terrific boss, and Nicky adored him. In a purely businesslike way, of course. Her heart was pretty impregnable these days, hardened by Chase's cruel defection. That had ended her dreams of marriage. The hated wealth that had blinded her to men's greed was gone now, too. And without her designer clothing and her diamonds, men didn't seem to notice her at all. Of course, her manner was stiff and off-putting with most men, but she didn't even realize it.</p><p> </p><p>"Your brother came to the office once, didn't he?" she ventured, recalling vaguely a tall, very cold sort of man she'd barely glimpsed on an unusually hectic day and had learned later that it was Mr. Christopher's mysterious older brother.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, he did," he said. "Winthrop owns a small share in the corporation, you see, but he's the silent partner. He doesn't care for desks and boardrooms. Dad left him the ranch, which is worth a mint, and I have an equally small share in that. He's primarily a cattleman, and I'm a businessman, so we each have what we like most. He's something of a loner. But as long as we keep out of his way, we won't have any trouble."</p><p> </p><p>That sounded ominous. She looked at the green-lined white steno pad in her lap. "A month is a long time," she said slowly.</p><p> </p><p>"Come on, Nicky, what have you got going that you can't walk away from?" he chided gently. "No boyfriends, no evening classes. A month in the country would do you good. If that wealth of potted plants you surround your desk with is any indication, you must be a country girl at heart. Or at the very least, a frustrated gardener."</p><p> </p><p>She laughed. "I do love plants. And, yes, I'm a country girl. I was born and bred in Kentucky," she confessed, "and I guess I do miss it sometimes. My people were farmers," she added, tossing off the white lie as easily as she twirled the pen in her slender hand. That was the story she told people, anyway, and it prevented a lot of embarrassing questions about why she'd given up all that money.</p><p> </p><p>"And farming isn't the best profession to be in these days," he agreed with a fond smile. "I can see why you came to the big city. But since you do like the country, I presume, where's the problem?"</p><p> </p><p>She sighed. "It's not quite orthodox."</p><p> </p><p>"No, little puritan, it isn't," he agreed. "But for the next month, you're my private secretary and I'll even increase your salary to make it more acceptable."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, but that's not nec--" she began.</p><p> </p><p>"Certainly it is," he countered, waving a lean hand at her. "I'm tired of the rat race, Nicky. I need rest or this ulcer is going to put me in the hospital. We'll both benefit from some mountain air."</p><p> </p><p>"It's October," she reminded him. "Late October. Doesn't it snow in Montana in late October?"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, frequently," he agreed. "And the ranch is way up in the Rockies, near the Todd place--" he paused, glancing at her with an odd expression "--you remember Sadie, don't you?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes. She was very nice." A nurse, in fact, and Nicole's taciturn young boss had dated her and had been devastated when she left several months ago to take care of her invalid mother. Hmm, Nicole thought; that was about the time his health problems reared their ugly head.</p><p> </p><p>"Anyway, the ranch is near the Todd place," he continued, "and we used to get snowed in a good bit. But we always get a chinook when we need one, and we can dig our way out. Stop worrying."</p><p> </p><p>"What's a chinook?"</p><p> </p><p>"A warm wind that comes unexpectedly to melt the snow," he said, smiling. "You'll love it there, Nicky. I promise."</p><p> </p><p>I hope so, she thought. All at once she wondered if he had more than just health reasons for wanting to work at home. Sadie had managed to drag him out of his shell, and there had been a tangible something between them before her abrupt departure. It might turn out to be an interesting trip. "All right, I'll go," she agreed. "But you're sure your brother won't mind?"</p><p> </p><p>He looked vaguely disturbed for a second. Then he smiled. "Of course I'm sure."</p><p> </p><p>Nicky wondered later about that hesitation. Mr. Christopher had hardly ever mentioned his brother in all the time she'd worked for him. But through the office grapevine there had been some small bit of gossip about the Montana rancher, something someone had whispered just after his brief visit. If only she could remember it.</p><p> </p><p>Becky, a blond and vivacious woman who worked for one of the vice presidents, breezed into the office after Mr. Christopher had left for the day.</p><p> </p><p>"What's this I hear about some exotic vacation you're taking with the big boss?" she teased.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky laughed. "If you call the backwoods of Montana exotic, then I guess it's true." She sighed as she covered the computer. "I do hope you'll come to my funeral. I have visions of being eaten by a puma or carried off by a moose."</p><p> </p><p>"You might be carried off by Winthrop." Becky grinned.</p><p> </p><p>"Or haven't you heard the grizzly tales about him?"</p><p> </p><p>Nicole turned, her eyes wide and curious. "Is he terrible?"</p><p> </p><p>"A wild man, from what we hear. They said some society girl threw him over a few years back, and he actually went to her engagement party with a Hollywood movie star--a girl who turned out to have been a school friend of his and owed him a favor. He called up the friend and paid her expenses all the way from Hollywood, just for the occasion. Ruined the event, of course, since the movie star got all the attention. He used to be a ladies' man and he's always been well-to-do, and he traveled in those very ritzy circles. But since then, he's pretty much given up his playboy status and turned to the great outdoors. They say his experience with the blond heiress has soured him against rich women in a big way. Can't blame him too much, can you?"</p><p> </p><p>"He sounds...interesting." Nicky chose her words carefully; it wouldn't do to show her fear.</p><p> </p><p>"Looks that way, too, except for the scars and the limp. Although the scars had faded nicely the day he was in here." She grinned at Nicky. "He sure gave you a look, but you were so busy you didn't even notice him."</p><p> </p><p>"I remember him, but I didn't look long enough to see the limp." She frowned. "How did he get it?"</p><p> </p><p>"From the wreck. Deanne Sharp--of the Aspen Sharps, you know, ski-resort wear and accessories, and Winthrop's fianc�e at the time--was driving. They crashed.

Kaluta and many more!</p><p>Writers and artists featured include Geoff Johns, Judd Winick, Whilce Portacio, Jill Thompson, John Bolton, Mike Mignola, Brian Azzarello, Darwyn Cooke, Chris Bachalo, Alan DavisThis series violates two long-standing superhero-comics conventions. It&#39;s in black and white, which has always been anathema to mainstream comics, and the eight-page succinctness of the stories in it has been out of favor ever since comic books ballooned into graphic novels, whose story lines sprawl through vast runs of single issues. This volume contains 33 pieces by some of mainstream comics&#39; hottest writers (Brian Azzarello, Ed Brubaker, Mike Carey, Geoff Johns) and artists (Brent Anderson, Chris Bachalo, Darwyn Cooke, Sean Phillips), as well as by other creators seldom associated with costumed crime fighters. Alt-comics figure Scott Morse (The Barefoot Serpent, 2003) illustrates a ghost story spotlighting Bruce Wayne&#39;s butler Alfred, and Archie Comics mainstay Dan DeCarlo&#39;s Batgirl more than passingly resembles Betty and Veronica. As in any such anthology, the quality of the contributions varies, but the best of them, which use the black-and-white format to create a noirish ambience or a heightened sense of drama, or simply to show off the artwork to full advantage, prove that there&#39;s much to be said for conciseness and monochrome.

In 636 AD, after protracted skirmishing and minor engagements the Arab and Byzantine armies faced each other on the banks of the Yarmuk river. The Byzantines were initially successful, driving back the Arab right wing. Finally, though, the Arab counter-attacks broke the Byzantine lines and the subsequent pursuit became a rout.

Here, Joe Eck and Wayne Winterrowd champion respect for the seasons and pride in workmanship as they invite us to share in their dedication to both the practicalities and the aesthetics of living off the land. <br><br>Living Seasonally puts special emphasis on the raising of vegetables. It details not only the day-to-day aspects of vegetable gardening but also the shaping of the garden to make it a beautiful space with its own particular emotional resonance, its own magic. Delicious recipes and photography complete what will surely become a gardening classic.<br><br></p><p>After 20-plus years of tutelage at the feet of Vermont's climate, landscape designers and authors Joe Eck and Wayne Winterrowd have mastered the art of living seasonally. Fundamentally, this means eating what's ripe in the garden--there's no freezing and very little canning at North Hill--when it's ripe. The meditative, ardent <i>Living Seasonally: The Kitchen Garden and the Table at North Hill</i> describes this life hitched to the wax and wane of the seasons.<p> Eck and Winterrowd, who also authored <i>A Year at North Hill: Four Seasons in a Vermont Garden</i>, go into luxurious detail on the tiniest aspects of horticultural and barnyard life. These two are passionate and effective teachers--so much so that, by page 43, the reader fully understands their characterization of pumpkin vines as "as wayward as vegetable guineas," a reference to the hen with a mind of its own. We--even those of us who've never sprouted a seed or hoed a row--get it. But some of the most rewarding passages in <i>Living Seasonally</i> are those that ruminate on the inevitable blending of the spiritual with the prosaic, as in this reflection on Vermont pumpkin pie, made with maple syrup from their own trees: </p><blockquote>We begin our syruping when the buds of the maples are tight-furled, hardly more than sharp, dull-green points along the bare stems.... By the time the pumpkins have been selected and sown, the leaves of the maples will have hardened into the thick shade of summer.... When the maple leaves have turned transparent again, all into orange and tawny yellow, the pumpkins must be gathered to cure in the warmth of the house. As they lie in heaps and piles, their colors reflect the autumn garden, and are a fit emblem of the season. An emblem, too, is the pie they make, where beginning and end and all the processes in between are caught up in a perfect round.</blockquote> This book will captivate both the avid gardener-cook with its recipes and techniques for planting and seed selection, and the citydweller searching for the answer to why it's impossible to find tomatoes that taste like tomatoes in January. <i>--Stefanie Durbin</i><br>Joe Eck and Wayne Winterrowd wrote the acclaimed A Year at North Hill (Owl Books 0-8050-4614-3, $19.95).

He found his high in the Wrangell Mountains of Alaska. Most sought wealth in gold; Birch found it in copper. Birch succeeded while others failed because he had assets that many prospectors lacked -- a technical education, wealthy friends and remarkable tenacity. He founded a gigantic corporation in an era when big business was a public enemy, persevering in the face of unwarranted abuse from ambitious politicians and muckraking journalists.

He made the discovery shortly before midnight on a rain-swept Wednesday in mid-September. And only because he had politely declined the persistent entreaties from the boys at work to attend the midweek bash at the Godolphin Arms up in Marazion.</p><p>It was a mystery to Peel why they still bothered to invite him. Truth be told, he had never cared much for the company of drinkers. And these days, whenever he set foot in a pub, there was at least one intoxicated soul who would try to badger him into talking about "little Adam Hathaway." Six months earlier, in one of the most dramatic rescues in the history of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, Peel had plucked the six-year-old boy from the treacherous surf off Sennen Cove. The newspapers had crowned Peel a national hero but were then dumbfounded when the broad-shouldered twenty-two-year-old with movie-idol looks refused to grant a single interview. Peel's silence privately annoyed his colleagues, any one of whom would have leapt at the chance for a few moments of celebrity, even if it meant reciting the old clich�s about "the importance of teamwork" and "the proud traditions of a proud service." Nor did it sit well with the beleaguered residents of West Cornwall, who were always looking for a good reason to boast about a local boy and stick it to the English snobs from "up-country." From Falmouth Bay to Land's End, the mere mention of Peel's name invariably provoked a puzzled shake of the head. A bit odd, they would say. Always was. Must have been the divorce. Never knew his real father. And that mother! Always took up with the wrong sort. Remember Derek, the whiskey-soaked playwright? Heard he used to beat the lad. At least that was the rumor in Port Navas.</p><p>It was true about the divorce. And even the beatings. In fact, most of the idle gossip about Peel had a ring of accuracy. But none of it had anything to do with his refusal to accept his role as hero. Peel's silence was a tribute to a man he had known only briefly, a long time ago. A man who had lived just up Port Navas Quay in the old foreman's cottage near the oyster farm. A man who had taught him how to sail and how to repair old motorcars; who had taught him about the power of loyalty and the beauty of opera. A man who had taught him there was no reason to boast simply for doing one's job.</p><p>The man had a poetic foreign-sounding name, but Peel had always thought of him only as the stranger. He had been Peel's accomplice, Peel's guardian angel. And even though he had been gone from Cornwall for many years now, Peel occasionally still watched for him, just as he had when he was a boy of eleven. Peel still had the dog-eared logbook he had kept of the stranger's erratic comings and goings, and the photos of the eerie white lights that used to glow in the stranger's cottage at night. And even now, Peel could picture the stranger at the wheel of his beloved wooden ketch, coming up the Helford Passage after a long night alone on the sea. Peel would always be waiting in his bedroom window, his arm raised in a silent salute. And the stranger, when he spotted him, would always flash his running lights twice in response.</p><p>There were few reminders of those days left in Port Navas. Peel's mother had moved to Bath with her new lover. Derek the drunken playwright was rumored to be living in a beachfront hut in Wales. And the old foreman's cottage had been completely renovated and was now owned by posh weekenders from London who threw loud parties and were forever yelling at their spoiled children. All that remained of the stranger was his ketch, which he had bequeathed to Peel the night he fled Cornwall for parts unknown.</p><p>On that rainy evening in mid-September, the boat was bobbing at its mooring in the tidal creek, waves nudging gently against its hull, when an unfamiliar engine note lifted Peel from his bed and carried him back to his familiar outpost in the window. There, peering into the wet gloom, he spotted a metallic gray Range Rover making its way slowly along the road. It came to a stop outside the old foreman's cottage and idled a moment, headlamps doused, wipers beating a steady rhythm. Then the driver's-side door suddenly swung open, and a figure emerged wearing a dark green Barbour raincoat and a waterproof flat cap pulled low over his brow. Even from a distance, Peel knew instantly it was the stranger. It was the walk that betrayed him&#x2014;the confident, purposeful stride that seemed to propel him effortlessly toward the edge of the quay. He paused there briefly, carefully avoiding the pool of light from the single lamp, and stared at the ketch. Then he quickly descended the flight of stone steps to the river and disappeared from view.</p><p>At first, Peel wondered whether the stranger had come back to lay claim to the boat. But that fear receded when he suddenly reappeared, clutching a small parcel in his left hand. It was about the size of a hardcover book and appeared to be wrapped in plastic. Judging from the coat of slime on the surface, the package had been concealed for a long time. Peel had once imagined the stranger to be a smuggler. Perhaps he had been right after all.</p><p>It was then Peel noticed that the stranger was not alone. Someone was waiting for him in the front seat of the Rover. Peel couldn't quite make out the face, only a silhouette and a halo of riotous hair. He smiled for the first time. It seemed the stranger finally had a woman in his life.</p><p>Peel heard the muffled thump of a door closing and saw the Rover lurch instantly forward. If he hurried, there was just enough time to intercept it. Instead, in the grips of a feeling he had not known since childhood, he stood motionless in the window, arm raised in a silent salute. The Rover gathered speed and for an instant Peel feared the stranger had not seen the signal. Then it slowed suddenly and the headlamps flashed twice before passing beneath Peel's window and vanishing into the night. Peel remained at his post a moment longer, listening as the sound of the engine faded into silence. Then he climbed back into bed and pulled his blankets beneath his chin. His mother was gone, Derek was in Wales, and the old foreman's cottage was under foreign occupation. But for now, Peel was not alone. The stranger had returned to Cornwall.</p><br><br><p><b>PART ONE</b><br>PROVENANCE</p><p>1<br>GLASTONBURY, ENGLAND</p><p>Though the stranger did not know it, two disparate series of events were by that night already conspiring to lure him back onto the field of battle. One was being played out behind the locked doors of the world's secret intelligence services while the other was the subject of a global media frenzy. The newspapers had dubbed it "the summer of theft," the worst epidemic of art heists to sweep Europe in a generation. Across the Continent, priceless paintings were disappearing like postcards plucked from the rack of a sidewalk kiosk. The anguished masters of the art universe had professed shock over the rash of robberies, though the true professionals inside law enforcement admitted it was small wonder there were any paintings left to steal. "If you nail a hundred million dollars to a poorly guarded wall," said one beleaguered official from Interpol, "it's only a matter of time before a determined thief will try to walk away with it."</p><p>The brazenness of the criminals was matched only by their competence. That they were skilled was beyond question. But what the police admired most about their opponents was their iron discipline. There were no leaks, no signs of internal intrigue, and not a single demand for ransom&#x2014;at least not a real one. The thieves stole often but selectively, never taking more than a single painting at a time. These were not amateurs looking for quick scores or organized crime figures looking for a source of underworld cash. These were <i>art</i> thieves in the purest sense. One weary detective predicted that in all likelihood the paintings taken that long, hot summer would be missing for years, if not decades. In fact, he added morosely, chances were extremely good they would find their way into the Museum of the Missing and never be seen by the public again.</p><p>Even the police marveled at the variety of the thieves' game. It was a bit like watching a great tennis player who could win on clay one week and grass the next. In June, the thieves recruited a disgruntled security guard at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna and carried out an overnight theft of Caravaggio's <i>David with the Head of Goliath</i>. In July, they opted for a daring commandostyle raid in Barcelona and relieved the Museu Picasso of <i>Portrait of Se�ora Canals</i>. Just one week later, the lovely <i>Maisons � Fenouillet</i> vanished so quietly from the walls of the Matisse Museum in Nice that bewildered French police wondered whether it had grown a pair of legs and walked out on its own. And then, on the last day of August, there was the textbook smash-and-grab job at the Courtauld Gallery in London that netted <i>Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear</i> by Vincent van Gogh. Total time of the operation was a stunning ninety-seven seconds&#x2014;even more impressive given the fact that one of the thieves had paused on the way out a second-floor window to make an obscene gesture toward Modigliani's luscious <i>Female Nude</i>. By that evening, the surveillance video was required viewing on the Internet. It was, said the Courtauld's distraught director, a fitting end to a perfectly dreadful summer.</p><p>The thefts prompted a predictable round of finger-pointing over lax security at the world's museums. The <i>Times</i> reported that a recent internal review at the Courtauld had strongly recommended moving the Van Gogh to a more secure location. The findings had been rejected, however, because the gallery's director liked the painting exactly where it was. Not to be outdone, the <i>Telegraph</i> weighed in with an authoritative series on the financial woes affecting Britain's great museums. It pointed out that the National Gallery and the Tate didn't even bother to insure their collections, relying instead on security cameras and poorly paid guards to keep them safe. "We shouldn't be asking ourselves how it is great works of art disappear from museum walls," the renowned London art dealer Julian Isherwood told the newspaper. "Instead, we should be asking ourselves why it doesn't happen more often. Little by little, our cultural heritage is being plundered."</p><p>The handful of museums with the resources to increase security rapidly did so while those living hand to mouth could only bar their doors and pray they were not next on the thieves' list. But when September passed without another robbery, the art world breathed a collective sigh of relief and blithely reassured itself the worst had passed. As for the world of mere mortals, it had already moved on to weightier matters. With wars still raging in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the global economy still teetering on the edge of the abyss, few could muster a great deal of moral outrage over the loss of four rectangles of canvas covered in paint.</p><p>The head of one international-aid organization estimated that the combined value of the missing works could feed the hungry in Africa for years to come. Would it not be better, she asked, if the rich did something more useful with their excess millions than line their walls and fill their secret bank vaults with art?</p><p>Such words were heresy to Julian Isherwood and his brethren, who depended on the avarice of the rich for their living. But they did find a receptive audience in Glastonbury, the ancient city of pilgrimage located west of London in the Somerset Levels. In the Middle Ages, the Christian faithful had flocked to Glastonbury to see its famous abbey and to stand beneath the Holy Thorn tree, said to have sprouted when Joseph of Arimathea, disciple of Jesus, laid his walking stick upon the ground in the Year of Our Lord 63. Now, two millennia later, the abbey was but a glorious ruin, the remnants of its once-soaring nave standing forlornly in an emerald parkland like gravestones to a dead faith. The new pilgrims to Glastonbury rarely bothered to visit, preferring instead to traipse up the slopes of the mystical hill known as the Tor or to shuffle past the New Age paraphernalia shops lining the High Street. Some came in search of themselves; others, for a hand to guide them. And a few actually still came in search of God. Or at least a reasonable facsimile of God.</p><p>Christopher Liddell had come for none of these reasons. He had come for a woman and stayed for a child. He was not a pilgrim. He was a prisoner.</p><p>It was Hester who had dragged him here&#x2014;Hester, his greatest love, his worst mistake. Five years earlier, she had demanded they leave Notting Hill so she could find herself in Glastonbury. But in finding herself, Hester discovered the key to her happiness lay in shedding Liddell. Another man might have been tempted to leave. But while Liddell could live without Hester, he could not contemplate life without Emily. Better to stay in Glastonbury and suffer the pagans and druids than return to London and become a faded memory in the mind of his only child. And so Liddell buried his sorrow and his anger and soldiered on. That was Liddell's approach to all things. He was reliable. In his opinion, there was no better thing a man could be.</p><p>Glastonbury was not entirely without its charms. One was the Hundred Monkeys caf�, purveyor of vegan and environmentally friendly cuisine since 2005, and Liddell's favorite haunt. Liddell sat at his usual table, a copy of the <i>Evening Standard</i> spread protectively before him. At an adjacent table, a woman of late middle age was reading a book entitled <i>Adult Children: The Secret Dysfunction</i>. In the far back corner, a bald prophet in flowing white pajamas was lecturing six rapt pupils about something to do with Zen spiritualism. And at the table nearest the door, hands bunched contemplatively beneath an unshaved chin, was a man in his thirties. His eyes were flickering over the bulletin board. It was filled with the usual rubbish&#x2014;an invitation to join the Glastonbury Positive Living Group, a free seminar on owl pellet dissection, an advertisement for Tibetan pulsing healing sessions&#x2014;but the man appeared to be scrutinizing it with an unusual devotion. A cup of coffee stood before him, untouched, next to an open notebook, also untouched. A poet searching for the inspiration, thought Liddell. A polemicist waiting for the rage.</p><p>Liddell examined him with a practiced eye. He was dressed in tattered denim and flannel, the Glastonbury uniform. His hair was dark and pulled back into a stubby ponytail, his eyes were nearly black and slightly glazed. On the right wrist was a watch with a thick leather band. On the left were several cheap silver bracelets. Liddell searched the hands and forearms for evidence of tattoos but found none. Odd, he thought, for in Glastonbury even grandmothers proudly sported their ink. Pristine skin, like sun in winter, was rarely seen.</p><p>The waitress appeared and flirtatiously placed a check in the center of Liddell's newspaper. She was a tall creature, quite pretty, with pale hair parted in the center ...</p></p><h2>Unrest</h2><p>Multi-award-winning Scandi crime series from the third bestselling author in Denmark.

Though he may not have reached the career heights of his father, Patrick Smithwick succeeded in carving his own niche as a top steeplechase rider.</p><p>Patrick Smithwick has written an unusually moving memoir about growing up in the hell-bent-for-leather world of Thoroughbred racing as the son of Hall of Fame steeplechase jockey A.P. "Paddy" Smithwick. <i> Racing My Father </i> is the story of a son working alongside his father throughout summer mornings, and then hopping in a "hot car," windows up, heater blasting - so his father can sweat off a few more pounds - and driving his father to the track where the races will be held in the afternoon. Paddy Smithwick was a natural. He was a charismatic figure. He was the greatest steeplechase rider in America in the 1950s and '60s, winning all the big races, leading the country in raes won four times, dominating the sport with his style, ability, heart, and gentlemanly demeanor. Patrick Smithwick is also a natural. As a jockey, he won steeplechase races. As a writer, he's won awards. There are hints of the innocence of Huck Finn as Smithwick starts off his account of serving his apprenticeship with his father. The innocence ends when his father is paralyzed in a bad fall. Yet, the youthful Smithwick helps his father work his way back into racing, and the father-son, trainer-rider team ends up in the winner's circle at Saratoga Springs. Smithwick has recreated his own Yoknapatawpha County - with its gritty backsides and polished clubhouses, its knotty characters and sleek racehorses. <i> Racing My Father </i> is not just another "horse" book. It is a fast-paced memoir ranking in the stakes race category with Russell Baker's <i> Growing Up </i>, Frank McCourt's <i> Angela's Ashes </i>, Annie Dillard's <i> An American Childhood </i>, and Beryl Markham's <i> West With the Night </i>. <i> Racing My Father </i> is a breathtaking ride over hurdles, with a whipping and driving finish, that catapults the father-son team of Paddy and Patrick Smithwick back into the winner's circle.Patrick Smithwick has been working with horses all his life. At a very young age he began working with his father, the legendary steeplechase jockey, A.P. Smithwick, who became a trainer after retiring from riding. Smithwick then worked his way through school and college by exercising Thoroughbreds at major East Coast racetracks and riding steeplechase races at such venues as Belmont Park and Saratoga Race Course, and hunt meets such as the Maryland Hunt Club and the Grand National. Smithwick received a bachelor of arts from Johns Hopkins University in 1973 followed by a master of arts in creative writing from Hollins College in 1975. After working in the newspaper business for several years, Smithwick began teaching English, philosophy, photography, and journalism at both the high school and collegiate levels. In 1988 he received a master of liberal arts from Johns Hopkins University and in 2000 he received his degree in education for ministry from University of the South. During this time, Smithwick taught as well as held the position of director of publications and public relations at two different schools. He has now turned his two biggest passions into two businesses - riding and training Thoroughbred steeplechase horses and writing. He also gives talks, teaches part-time, and does freelance writing. In addition to <i> Racing My Father </i>, Smithwick has written <i> The Art of Healing: Union Memorial Hospital </i> and <i> Gilman Voices, 1897-1997 </i>. He has also written for many publications including <i> Mid-Atlantic Thoroughbred, The Maryland Horse, Horsemen's Journal, </i> and <i> The Chronicle of the Horse </i>. Smithwick resides on the horse farm where he was raised in Monkton, Maryland, with his wife Ansley. They have three children: Paddy, Andrew, and Eliza.</p><h2>Red Unicorn</h2><p>The enchanting, magical sequel to <i>The Black Unicorn </i>and <i>The Gold Unicorn!</i><br><br>After several years traveling, Tanaquil &#x2014; a sorceress like her mother with the ability to mend &#x2014; returns home only to discover that her true love has been betrothed to her sister, Empress Lizra.

Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until is is hot but not smoking. Add the onions and saute for a few minutes until they begin to soften. Add the pancetta and cook until the pancetta and the onions are golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the figs and the wine and simmer just to soften the figs, about 5 minutes; don't cook the figs so long that they fall apart completely. Season with salt and pepper to taste and turn off the heat. 2. Meanwhile, bring a big saucepan of water to boil. Stir in a small fistful of salt and the pennette and cook until it is tender. Reserve a cupful of the pasta water and drain the pasta in a colander.3. Quickly transfer the pasta to the pan with the figs and place over high heat. Add a splash of pasta water, stir gently to mix the condimento and pasta together, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes, adding more pasta water if the pasta is dry or sticky.

She lives in Boulder, Colorado.PreSchool-Grade 2-A disgruntled feline tells his story. Everything in the house belongs to Merl until an intruder arrives-an annoying puppy that licks him and follows him around. When the golden retriever grows up, the cat hits the road, convinced that they can never be friends. Several people try to adopt Merl but nothing works out to his satisfaction. One lady dresses him up with bows and ribbons and a ridiculous striped jacket. Forlorn, he's rescued by the dog and taken home. Maybe they can be friends after all. Merl's first-person narrative is to the point; however, as the action progresses, the cat's deadpan, smugly superior voice begins to border on the pathetic. Instead of staying on the top of his game, he becomes a pawn through his own stubborn behavior; while his dress-up get-up may look funny, it only serves to highlight his fall from grace. Once back home, the cat declares himself the ruler but it's really the dog that wins children's hearts. Initially the scruffy, unkempt, free-flowing pastels are humorous and energizing. In the few scenes with people, the humans are pictured in photographic gray, creating an intriguing and visually arresting juxtaposition to the splashy, colorful animal world. However, as Merl continues to mope about on the pages, readers' interest and sympathy begin to wane. What starts out as funny and original becomes overused. Merl might tell readers he's "a very special cat," but it's hard to know why.<br><i>Martha Topol, Traverse Area District Library, Traverse City, MI</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Relentless Revolution: A History of Capitalism</h2><p><p><strong>The unlikely development of a potent historical force, told with grace, insight, and authority by one of our best historians.</strong></p> With its deep roots and global scope, the capitalist system provides the framework for our lives. It is a framework of constant change, sometimes measured and predictable, sometimes drastic and out of control. Yet what is now ubiquitous was not always so. Capitalism took shape centuries ago, starting with a handful of isolated changes in farming, trade, and manufacturing, clustered in early-modern England. Astute observers began to notice these changes and consider their effects. Those in power began to harness these new practices to the state, enhancing both. A system generating wealth, power, and new ideas arose to reshape societies in a constant surge of change.<br><br> The centuries-long history of capitalism is rich and eventful. Approaching capitalism as a culture, as important for its ideas and values as for its inventions and systems, Joyce Appleby gives us a fascinating introduction to this most potent creation of mankind from its origins to now.</p><p>Advance Praise for <em>The Relentless Revolution</em>:<br><br> &#x201c;Joyce Appleby&#x2019;s prolific historical writings on politics and economic thought have earned her a distinguished reputation for incisiveness and originality. <em>The Relentless Revolution</em>, a crowning achievement, shows that capitalism is as much a matter of values and ideas as of supply, demand, and balance sheets.

Starting in medieval England and ending with the global crisis that began in 2008, Appleby explores the successes and failures of capitalism over the last five hundred years and more.

The one painter who was almost single-handedly responsible for clothing the revolution in the mantle of the classical past was Jacques Louis David (1748-1825), one of the most controversial painters to have emerged from this turbulent period in the history of modern France. Although David's austere classical style has fallen out of fashion in recent years, Simon Lee's study <i>David</i> does a fine job of rescuing the artist from antiquarian curiosity, and placing him right back at the heart of revolutionary France.<p> Lee charts the rise of David from relative mediocrity as a highly academic painter to his enthusiastic support for the Revolution of 1789, culminating in his remarkable painting <i>Marat Breathing His Last</i> (1793). Arrested and narrowly avoiding execution in the political backlash following the overthrow of Robespierre, David turned his back on politics to concentrate on his art, only to find himself catapulted back into the political limelight with his fervent embrace of Napoleon Bonaparte. This loyalty formed the foundation of some of David's most imposing paintings, from the equestrian portraits of Napoleon to the pomp of <i>The Coronation of the Emperor and Empress</i>. But once again, David's political hopes were dashed with Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo in 1815, which led the painter into self-imposed exile in Brussels, where he died a decade later.</p><p> Despite Lee's rather wooden prose, this is a thorough, detailed, and generously illustrated study of a fascinatingly contradictory, patrician, but technically brilliant painter. <i>--Jerry Brotton</i></p>Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825) was the most important European artist in a period of extraordinary upheaval. A participant in the French Revolution, he then witnessed the rise and fall of Napoleon Bonaparte. A revolutionary in both art and life, David took painting away from the frivolity of the Rococo towards the dramatic moral force of neoclassicism. Passionate, intense, fiercely ambitious and a shrewd businessman, David brought to life in his paintings the heroic deeds of the ancient world, commemorated the revolutionary years in France and glorified the reign of Napoleon. In this comprehensive book Simon Lee employs up-to-date scholarship to present a view of David that incorporates artistic, political and social concerns. It deals with all aspects of his career and character and traces his changing relationships with his patrons. Lee follows David&#39;s career from his early student years in Rome, through his time as chief artist to the revolutionary government and Napoleon, to his life in exile in Brussels.</p><h2>Killing the Hidden Waters</h2><p><p>In the quarter-century since his first book, Killing the Hidden Waters, was published in 1977, Charles Bowden has become one of the premier writers on the American environment, rousing a generation of readers to both the wonder and the tragedy of humanity's relationship with the land.</p><p>Revisiting his earliest work with a new introduction, "What I Learned Watching the Wells Go Down," Bowden looks back at his first effort to awaken people to the costs and limits of using natural resources through a simple and obvious example&#x2014;water. He drives home the point that years of droughts, rationing, and even water wars have done nothing to slake the insatiable consumption of water in the American West. Even more timely now than in 1977, Killing the Hidden Waters remains, in Edward Abbey's words, "the best all-around summary I've read yet, anywhere, of how our greed-driven, ever-expanding urban-industrial empire is consuming, wasting, poisoning, and destroying not only the resource basis of its own existence, but also the vital, sustaining basis of life everywhere."</p></p><p>Charles Bowden lived and wrote in Tucson, Arizona. His recent books include Down by the River: Drugs, Money, Murder, and Family, Blues for Cannibals: Notes from Underground, Blood Orchid: An Unnatural History of America, and Desierto: Memories of the Future.&#34;This slender book brims with wisdom and scholarship.&#34; Harold Scarlett, Houston Post &#34;Charles Bowden&#39;s Killing the Hidden Waters is the best all-around summary I&#39;ve read yet, anywhere, of how our greed-driven, ever-expanding urbanindustrial empire is consuming, wasting, poisoning and destroying not only the resource basis of its own existence but also the vital, sustaining basis of all life everywhere. This one little book tells the whole story. In my opinion, Charles Bowden is the best social critic and environmental journalist now working in the Amcrican southwest, a sharp and engaging writer who never lets his cool disgust at our collective stupidity erode his fundamental sympathy for thc actual living, breathing, still hopeful human beings who inhabit this besieged land.

Inspired by the imperial legacy of those such as the British, the Third Reich cast its shadow from the Channel Islands to the Caucasus and ruled hundreds of millions. Yet, as Mark Mazower&#39;s groundbreaking new account shows, it was an empire built on an illusion. From Hitler&#39;s plans for vast motorways crossing an ethnically cleansed Russian steppe, to dreams of a German super-economy rivalling America&#39;s, Mazower reveals the lethal fusion of mass murder, modern managerialism and colossal incompetence that underpinned the Nazi New Order. Ultimately Hitler&#39;s empire ended up consuming its own, leaving destruction in its wake and finishing not just with the downfall of Germany, but an entire continent.</p><p>Mark Mazower is the author of Inside Hitler&#39;s Greece, Dark Continent: Europe&#39;s Twentieth Century, The Balkans, which won the Wolfson Prize for History, and Salonika: City of Ghosts, which won both the Runciman Prize and the Duff Cooper Prize. He has taught at the University of Sussex, Princeton University and Birkbeck College, University of London. He is now Professor of History at Columbia University.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Andrew Nagorski Surveying Nazi Germany's conquests shortly after it invaded the Soviet Union, Hitler's minister of economics boasted: "Never before in the history of the world has there been such an economy to administer." Germany was indeed the master of most of Europe at that point, and its armies were marching quickly into Russia. But in Hitler's Empire, Columbia University historian Mark Mazower spells out how ill-prepared the Germans were for their string of early victories -- and how completely they botched the administration of their empire. Many histories have focused on Hitler's costly military mistakes, particularly on the Eastern Front. Mazower largely ignores the battlefields and focuses instead on the political, racial and economic policies of the Nazi conquerors. While many parts of this story have been told before, he painstakingly examines a huge body of evidence for insights into Nazi misrule. This hardly makes for light reading, but it allows him to present a compelling case, which was best summarized by a German general at the end of the war. Addressing his fellow POWs, Ferdinand Heim argued that the German war effort would have been doomed "even if no military mistakes had been made." The reason: Nazi articles of faith amounted to grotesque fantasies about how the New Order would function, and they couldn't possibly survive prolonged, or even relatively short, clashes with reality. Leaving morality aside, the Holocaust made no economic sense at a time when Germany was desperately short of workers. When Victor Brack, one of the officials charged with carrying out the Final Solution, suggested that between 2 and 3 million Jews could be sterilized and put to work rather than killed, Hitler wasn't interested. The German leader's plans for the rest of the people in the East were even more absurd in economic terms, since they involved the majority of the local inhabitants, not just minorities. Under Nazi doctrine, Germanization was the overarching goal, which meant eliminating as many non-Germans as possible and finding and elevating local Germans or bringing in new German settlers. But after Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland in 1939, 90 percent of the inhabitants of German-occupied territory were Poles and only 6 percent ethnic Germans. And as the empire grew, the proportions of ethnic Germans became even smaller. In the midst of a widening conflict, German officials methodically photographed and examined Polish families, discriminating in favor of those who appeared to have "the soundest German blood." All of which was guaranteed to stir resentment. Even Colonel-General Johannes von Blaskowitz, one of the German commanders in Poland, noted: "The idea that one can intimidate the Polish population by terrorism and rub their noses in the dirt will certainly prove false." Nowhere was that miscalculation more costly than in the Soviet Union. After Stalin's purges and forced collectivization of the 1930s, some Ukrainians, Lithuanians and even Russians were prepared to view any invaders as possible saviors. Hitler's ruthless policies, directed not just against Jews but also against Soviet POWs and the entire civilian population, quickly disabused them of such notions. That part of the story is fairly well-known. But Mazower goes one step further by demonstrating the hypothetical alternative. He points to the relatively enlightened occupation of southern Ukraine and Odessa. In the port city, locals could open businesses if they offered the right bribes, and visiting Germans were astonished by the thriving shops, restaurants and cafes -- all with plenty of food. "It simply showed what could have happened across the former Soviet territories," Mazower writes, "if the Germans had allowed markets to flourish and not planned to destroy the social order." Ironically, the industrialized economies of Western Europe, where German rule was far less draconian than in the East, contributed more to the German war effort than the Eastern territories did. By deliberately starving their Eastern subjects, the Germans only contributed to the poor performance of the agricultural sector. And yet it was the East that mesmerized Hitler, whose whole notion of Lebensraum was built on the premise that Germany would harvest great riches there, using largely mythic German settlers. There simply weren't anywhere near the number of Germans needed to transform those fantasies into reality. At times, Mazower's sweeping survey feels forced, trying to cover everything -- the origins of Nazism, the Holocaust, collaboration and resistance in all parts of occupied Europe. Inevitably, there are some questionable generalizations. In explaining the Nazi New Order, Mazower asserts, "the quest to unify Germans within a single German state" was more important than anti-Semitism or than the lust for conquest -- as if these are contradictory impulses. But all the way through, Mazower offers incisive details and insights that make Hitler's Empire a fascinating read. He points out, for example, that the United States accounted for 67 percent of the world's oil output in 1943 and the Soviet Union only 10 percent. So here, too, Hitler's basic assumptions about what he would gain by conquering the East were flawed: Even if his armies had taken the oil fields in the Caucasus, he wouldn't have solved his energy problem. Luckily for Germany's opponents, the master race was totally impervious to something as mundane as logic. <br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

He developed his own method of bodywork, Seiki Soho, after studying extensively in the fields of Shiatsu, Haruchika Noguchi&#39;s Seitai and bio-energetics until, coming up against the limits of Shiatsu, he experienced a profound change in consciousness, out of which Seiki Soho emerged. Born in 1949 in the Gunma region of Japan, Kishi was originally taught by his father, an accomplished judo master, who introduced him to manual therapy when he was just 9 years old. His formal training took place at Tokujiro Namikoshi&#39;s Japan Shiatsu College and at the Iokai Centre in Tokyo with Shizuto Masunaga, the father of Zen Shiatsu. Kishi assisted Masunaga for 10 years, and is widely regarded as the heir to his work.

Christopher draws inspiration for the world of Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, from the natural beauty that surrounds his home in Montana: the tumultuous weather, the rushing Yellowstone River, and the soaring Beartooth Mountains. <br><br>Read on for Paolini and Tad Williams's discussion about why they write fantasy, their upcoming projects, and more. <br> <br> <strong>Tad:</strong> Hi, Christopher. Nice to talk to you, albeit virtually. It was great hanging out with you and your family this summer. Pretty much all of us fell in love with your part of the world, too. <br><br> Be warned: this isn't my best time of the day, so if I start calling you "Herman" and asking what it was about whaling that interested you, please forgive. <br><br> The first thing I'd like to ask you as a starter question is: why fantasy? I mean, there's the obvious answer (which is also true for me) that it was something I loved to read growing up, but I guess I'm curious what is it that still resonates for you. Why do these kind of stories, these kinds of characters, these kinds of worlds, still speak to you? <br> In a similar vein, do you have another kind of fiction, another genre, that you'd really like to try? If so, why? Any genres you think you'll never write but wish you could? <br> <br> <strong>Christopher:</strong> Hi Tad. Great talking to you as well. We all had a wonderful time when you guys visited. Definitely one of the highlights of the year. <br> <br> I'm still waking up as well -- takes a few cups of tea and a few strips of bacon before the little gray cells start firing properly -- so if I sound a bit muddled, that's why. Still, we can make a stab at coherency, eh? <br><br> Hmm. Why do I write fantasy? As you said, it's because I enjoy reading it, but I enjoy reading it because . . . well, for a number of reasons, I suppose. First of all, fantasy allows for all sorts of dangerous situations, and those can provide a lot of excitement in a story. And excitement is always fun. Also, epic fantasy usually deals with themes and situations that everyone can relate to, such as the challenge of growing up, or how one is supposed to deal with moral quandaries. Fantasy is the oldest form of literature; the very first stories that humans told while crouched around campfires were stories about gods and monsters and tragic mistakes and heroic feats. Even now, those topics still resonate with us on a primal level, which is one reason I think fantasy will remain popular with readers as long as humans are still human. And I love the sense of awe and wonder one can often find in fantastical literature. . . . Fantasy can allow you to see and hear and experience things that have never existed and never *could* exist. To me, that is the closest we come to real magic in this world. <br><br>&nbsp; That said, there are a number of other genres I'd like to try my hand at: mystery, thriller, horror, science-fiction, romance, etc. I love stories of all kinds -- although mythic ones certainly hold the greatest appeal to me -- and I'm very much looking forward to experimenting once I finish the Inheritance cycle. Any genres I think I'll never write but wish I could? . . . Probably long-form epic poetry or a witty comedy of manners. Poetry is fun, but my grasp on it is rather shaky, and a comedy of manners (while I enjoy them) is so different from my usual life, I'm not sure I could pull it off properly. <br> <br> And now a question for you: You have just finished your third (large) series. What is it about big epic stories that so fascinates you? Why not write small, intimate books about a fishmonger whose greatest love is his toothpick sculpture of the Brooklyn Bridge? <br> <br> <strong> Read the full conversation </strong>Former singer, shoe-seller and radio show host, Tad Williams is now a full-time writer.

It may sound simple, but winning hearts is tricky business. While Chocolat had no problem enticing witch-boys with her forthright personality, human boys seem to be drawn to shy and modest girls like Vanilla. And to make matters worse, Chocolat is finding herself increasingly drawn to the cool and mysterious Pierre&#x2013;who feels nothing for her! The girls had planned to be best friends forever, but both of them want to be Queen. Will their rivalry ruin their friendship?</p><p>Following in the witch-girl subgenre, this manga is the story of Vanilla and Chocolat, two best friends competing to be Queen of the Magic World. They go to earth to see who can attract more boys and capture their hearts as jewels of different colors. If your teeth aren't aching yet, then you may be the target audience for this book. At first, Chocolat's too brusque and Vanilla's too shy, but the outgoing one quickly learns that human boys prefer a demure, suggestible girl, always thanking people and apologizing, so Vanilla gathers hearts more easily. Chocolat, meanwhile, may be falling in love with an older student called the Ice Prince, but if magical girls fall in love, they could die. The leads' huge eyes and hair makes them look all of their 10 years old, which contrasts oddly with the beautiful boys hanging around them and the strange, cynical views of emotions and manipulation. This attempt at a modern fairy tale is trying too hard, especially with the message that quiet girls make more friends.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The massive landing on France's coast had been meticulously planned for three years, and the Allies anticipated a quick and decisive defeat of the German forces. Many of the planners were surprised, however, by the length of time it ultimately took to defeat the Germans.<br><br>While much has been written about D-day, very little has been written about the crucial period from August to September, immediately after the invasion. In <i>R�ckzug</i>, Joachim Ludewig draws on military records from both sides to show that a quick defeat of the Germans was hindered by excessive caution and a lack of strategic boldness on the part of the Allies, as well as by the Germans' tactical skill and energy. This intriguing study, translated from German, not only examines a significant and often overlooked phase of the war, but also offers a valuable account of the conflict from the perspective of the German forces.</p><p><b>Joachim Ludewig</b> is an officer in the German Army Reserve. He currently serves as a civil servant in the German Defense Ministry.<br><br><b>Major General David T. Zabecki, AUS (Ret.)</b>, is the author of <i>The German 1918 Offensives: A Case Study in the Operational Level of War</i> and editor emeritus of <i>Vietnam</i> magazine. He holds the Shifrin Distinguished Chair in Military and Naval History at the United States Naval Academy and is also an Honorary Senior Research Fellow in the War Studies Programme at the University of Birmingham (United Kingdom)."Much has been written in English on the Normandy invasion and campaign, as well as on later events, but virtually nothing is known of the crucial period from mid-August to mid-September 1944. Ludewig is the first historian to document in detail the Wehrmacht's retreat from France from the German perspective. He has produced a very solidly researched and documented study on a neglected area of the 1944 campaign in France. His analysis is clear and his explanations of German skill and missed Allied opportunities judicious."&#x2015;<i>Stephen G. Fritz, author of Ostkrieg: Hitler's War of Extermination in the East</i><p>"<i>R�ckzug</i> is an important book. It is the first serious study to focus on the six-week period from the Operation Dragoon landings on the Mediterranean coast in mid-August and the partial Allied victory at the Falaise pocket. . . . A professional and well-researched assessment of this surprisingly under-examined phase of World War II."&#x2015;Anthony Beevor, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"Authoritative, compelling, and very-well researched. <i>R�ckzug</i> is an invaluable addition to our understanding of the European war in 1944-1945, offering a long, hard look at the other side of the hill."&#x2015;Rick Atkinson, author of <i>An Army at Dawn</i> and <i>The Day of Battle</i></p><p>"A detailed, comprehensive account of the Wehrmacht's retreat from France. In spite of the desperate conditions under which it was conducted, it allowed the Germans to reconstitute a front along the Reich's western frontier and continue the war into 1945 at terrible cost to everyone. This is a major contribution to the history of World War II."&#x2015;Williamson Murray, author of <i>A War To Be Won: Fighting the Second World War</i></p><p>"Extensively documented from German sources, with this English edition edited by retired U.S. Army Major General Zabecki, this superior work is for all serious students of World War II military maneuvers."&#x2015;<i>Library Journal, starred review</i></p><p>"In <i>Ruckzug</i>, Joachim Ludewig, an official in the German defense ministry, who first published this newly translated study more than twenty years ago, describes the sudden collapse of German resistance in August 1944 and the headlong flight towards the German border... By stopping the story in September 1944, when the new front stabilised along the German and Dutch borders, he is writing a history of German military success and with it the possibility that absolute, unconditional defeat might have been avoided"&#x2015;<i>London Review of Books</i></p><p>"<i>[. . .] [A] fascinating read [. . . .] Ruckzug</i> is a most valuable addition to the historiography of the North-West Europe campaign, giving us a most revealing account of how the Germans managed to snatch salvation out of the jaws of certain defeat. Deeply researched and well written, the book is highly recommended to anyone with an interest in the campaign. Both the author and David Zabecki, the editor, are to be much congratulated."&#x2015;<i>Journal of Military History</i></p><p>"An excellent historical study of a course of events in need of explication."&#x2015;<i>New York Journal of Books</i></p><p>"The story of how the final offensive stalled for months. . . . Ludewig offers insight into a phase of the European theater that I had not read elsewhere."&#x2015;<i>Washington Times</i></p><p>"Ludewig has written a first-rate historical study that sheds important light on a critical period of World War II in western Europe. His solidly researched and well-documented book provides a much needed German perspective on planning and conduct of operations that has been lacking in English for far too long."&#x2015;John T. Greenwood, editor of <i>From Normandy to Victor:The War Diary of General Courtney H. Hodges and the First U.S. Army</i></p><p>"The translation, documentation, and editing of this new contribution to military studies are uniformly excellent, and Ludewig is to be commended on the value of his work and its accessibility.

Her wings fluttered in the soft breeze. <br> &#x201c;Do you smell that?&#x201d; she asked the other wild fairies as they hovered nearby. &#x201c;Spring is in the air!&#x201d; Daisy&#x2019;s blond curls bounced with her excitement. Her friend and sidekick, Bumble, whizzed in a circle around her. He was excited, too. <br> Spring was definitely in the air in Sugar Oak, the fairies&#x2019; grand oak tree home. Tiny buds of green were starting to appear at the ends of the old oak&#x2019;s branches. Birds were returning from their winter homes. They sang sweet songs to the fairies. <br> The wild fairies and their animal friends were very busy. It was time for the festival to celebrate the first bloom of spring. Blossom Bash was the biggest party of the year. This year it was the fairies&#x2019; turn to host the festival. It was a big responsibility, and there were lots of things to prepare! Everybody was excited, especially Daisy. <br> Daisy was in charge of the festival preparations. It was her job to make sure that everyone had a task and that the tasks were completed in time. Daisy was a natural leader. And she loved helping her friends. <br> Poppy zoomed past Daisy and the other fairies. The red blooms of her dress flapped up and down as she flew by. Spot, Poppy&#x2019;s ladybug friend, beat her speckled wings, trying to keep up. <br> &#x201c;Whoa!&#x201d; said Thistle, as he somersaulted out of Poppy&#x2019;s way. Now his spiky purple hair stood up even more. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the hurry?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Fiddlesticks!&#x201d; Poppy cried. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s so much to do! I don&#x2019;t know how we&#x2019;re going to get ready in time!&#x201d; <br> Daisy smiled at Poppy. She wasn&#x2019;t worried. She was about to tell Poppy not to worry either when a raindrop tickled the end of her nose.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fiddlesticks!&#x201d; Poppy cried again. <br> The wild fairies flitted into the Great Hall of Sugar Oak. They watched through the windows as the rain came down strong and hard. It was the first big rainstorm of the season. <br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s beautiful!&#x201d; Celosia said. She wiggled her nose, and the freckles dotting her cheeks wiggled, too. &#x201c;All this rain will help the flowers grow. This is going to be the best spring bloom we&#x2019;ve had in years!&#x201d; Daisy added. She could already see the festival coming to life with colors everywhere. <br> &#x201c;But we&#x2019;re not ready!&#x201d; Poppy sighed. &#x201c;The more rain we get, the sooner the bloom is going to happen.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think about that,&#x201d; Indigo said. She touched the purple bandana around her neck and looked worried. <br> &#x201c;What should we do?&#x201d; Heather asked. <br> All the fairies looked at Daisy. She held up her hands and smiled one of her warm, easy smiles. &#x201c;Everything is going to be fine!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We all have our jobs for the festival, so the work is being done. We just need to decide on decorations for Sugar Oak, and we have a meeting about that tonight.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Do you have a to-do list?&#x201d; Poppy asked. &#x201c;What about a clipboard?&#x201d; <br> Daisy laughed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a clipboard, Poppy. And the plans are all up here.&#x201d; She tapped the side of her head, making the daisy flower in her hair jiggle. <br> Poppy frowned and plopped down on a tree knot. She was such a worrier! <br> Daisy flew over and gave her a quick hug. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be great.

In <i>An Instinct for Truth</i>, Robert Pennock explores this scientific mindset and argues that what Charles Darwin called &#x201c;an instinct for truth, knowledge, and discovery&#x201d; has a tacit moral structure&#x2015;that it is important not only for scientific excellence and integrity but also for democracy and human flourishing. In an era of &#x201c;post-truth,&#x201d; the scientific drive to discover empirical truths has a special value.</p><p>Taking a virtue-theoretic perspective, Pennock explores curiosity, veracity, skepticism, humility to evidence, and other scientific virtues and vices. He explains that curiosity is the most distinctive element of the scientific character, by which other norms are shaped; discusses the passionate nature of scientific attentiveness; and calls for science education not only to teach scientific findings and methods but also to nurture the scientific mindset and its core values.</p><p>Drawing on historical sources as well as a sociological study of more than a thousand scientists, Pennock's philosophical account is grounded in values that scientists themselves recognize they should aspire to. Pennock argues that epistemic and ethical values are normatively interconnected, and that for science and society to flourish, we need not just a philosophy of science, but a philosophy of the scientist.</p></p><p>Robert T. Pennock is University Distinguished Professor of History, Philosophy, and Sociology of Science at Michigan State University in the Lyman Briggs College and the Departments of Philosophy and Computer Science and Engineering. He is the author of <i>Tower of Babel: The Evidence against the New Creationism</i> (MIT Press).<p>&#x201c;In <i>An Instinct for Truth</i>, a wide-ranging volume on philosophical, historical, religious and sociological aspects of the scientific vocation, Robert T. Pennock shows that not only is curiosity a powerful motivator in the drive for reliable knowledge, it also, if guided by a virtuous scientist, leads to socially beneficial outcomes. Any practicing scientist or student of science can benefit from Pennock's observations about why we do science, or more, how to do science right.&#x201d;</p>&#x2015;<b>Rush D. Holt</b>, CEO and Executive Publisher, American Association for the Advancement of Science<br><br><p><i>&#x201c;An Instinct for Truth</i> is a very important book. A pioneering exercise in what the author calls 'virtue philosophy of science,' and also, thanks to the empirical research, a groundbreaking exercise in experimental philosophy, Robert Pennock's book explores with much learning and sensitivity the values that guide the scientific mind, showing how great science is a deeply moral endeavor, in great part because the practitioners recognize and respect both the opportunities and restraints of empirical research. This is essential reading for philosophers across the spectrum, epistemologists and ethicists both.&#x201d;</p>&#x2015;<b>Michael Ruse</b>, Lucyle T. Werkmeister Professor of Philosophy, Florida State University<br><br><p>&#x201c;The sculpting of virtuous character is not incidental to doing science right. Objectivity in research requires refined moral dispositions without which our trust in science is unjustifiable. As Robert Pennock demonstrates in this elegant and well-argued work, there is hardly a virtuous habit whose cultivation cannot contribute to the enhancement of science as an honorable and truthful profession. I hope many scientists will read this book. Attending assiduously to Pennock's argument will not only make them better scientists, it will also make them better persons."</p>&#x2015;<b>John F. Haught</b>, Distinguished Professor of Theology at Georgetown University; author of The New Cosmic Story: Inside Our Awakening Universe<br><br><p>&#x201c;Pennock uses virtue theory to provide valuable new perspectives on philosophy of science and research ethics. All humans are somewhat curious about various aspects of the world, but in science that curiosity is organized and there is independent testing of what individuals have discovered. Not only does science have many practical applications, the moral values at its core can inspire a greater respect for truth-seeking in society at large.&#x201d;</p>&#x2015;<b>Noretta Koertge</b>, Emeritus Professor, Department of History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine, Indiana University</p><h2>The Key of Solomon the King (Clavicula Salomonis)</h2><p>This book, translated and edited by the occultist Samuel Liddell Mathers (1854-1918) and published in 1889, introduced to Victorian England an important work of Renaissance esoterica.

" &#x2014;<b><i>Kirkus Reviews,</i> starred Review<p></p></b>"While the alphabetic arrangement provides an organizational scheme and an informational resource, children will return to the illustrations to revel in Geisert's detailed etchings of farmers working and relaxing. The story spans the four seasons with touches of humor, solemnity, and of course, pigs a-plenty. Several scenes, rendered in strong, black silhouettes, lend an air of calm and contrast.

It is about good and bad times, then and now, about fantasy and reality, backflashes and nightmares and about the healing process of telling and remembering. It is a powerful view into a jarring and disconnected war. The themes of wounds and healing, of buried feelings and well-defended postures are held together by this book. It is a story of good soldiers in a bad war, young women who grew old in Vietnam, of women who have reclaimed their memories and themselves.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Diver! Diver!

He lives in Berkeley, California."Kluger's last venture into the history of American journalism was <i>The Paper</i>, his 1986 monumental autopsy of the New York Herald Tribune, and he brings the same gifts...to this book: vivid storytelling, built on exacting research, a knack for animating the context, and an exquisitesense of balance that honors this country's essential press freedomwithout romanticizing its champions."<br><br>-- Bill Keller, The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Kluger tells the complex and thoroughly engaging history leading upto...Zenger's trial for seditious libel of a government figure.... Zenger'strial does not unfold until the final chapter.&nbsp; But Kluger writes withsuch vivid detail and brisk pacing that the rather tortuous history that leads there is packed with drama....&nbsp; Fascinating, too, is Kluger'sanalysis of the rhetorical strategies employed...by the Journal....In theage of internet publishing, printed news has reduced resources, andoriginal investigative journalism increasingly shares digital space with speculative 'hot takes.' Kluger's illuminating history makes clear thefar more restrictive circumstances of the press in the 18th century, and it stands as a cautionary tale of what might happen if we let historyrepeat itself."<br><br>-- Amy Brody, Los Angeles Review of Books<br><br>"This story is all the more important because it is less about Zengerthe man than it is about how efforts by governments to keep the peoplequiet when they protest official misconduct must be resisted at allcosts....&nbsp; What is so timely about this well-written and thoroughlyresearched book is its reminder that no civil right extended to theAmerican people is set in stone or inviolable....&nbsp; President Obama as well as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump should read this book but probablywill not.&nbsp; But you ought to, if only to stiffen your sinews."<br><br>-- James Srodes, The Washington Times</p><h2>In Search of Nature</h2><p><p>Perhaps more than any other scientist of our century, Edward O. Wilson has scrutinized animals in their natural settings, tweezing out the dynamics of their social organization, their relationship with their environments, and their behavior, not only for what it tells us about the animals themselves, but for what it can tell us about human nature and our own behavior. He has brought the fascinating and sometimes surprising results of these studies to general readers through a remarkable collection of books, including <i>The Diversity of Life, The Ants, On Human Nature</i>, and <i>Sociobiology</i>.</p></p><p>Biologist Edward O. Wilson has been observing humans and nature in a career in biology that spans more than four decades. For the last 10 years or so, he has labored to alert us to the dangers we face due to the decline in the "diversity of life, which we are so recklessly diminishing through species extinction." The essays in <i>In Search of Nature</i> range widely. He gives us tales of nature's boundless variety with creatures like the reservoir ant and the cookie cutter shark and with a discussion of the importance of taxonomy. In the final essay, "Is Humanity Suicidal?" he returns to the topic that seems to be most on his mind: mankind's assault on the world of nature.Edward O. Wilson is widely recognized as one of the world&#x2019;s leading scientists. He is the winner of the Pulitzer Prize and author of The Social Conquest of Earth.</p><h2>The Serpent Came to Gloucester</h2><p><b>Drawing on a true story, an award-winning author and illustrator present a picture-book tribute to the beauty and mystery of the ocean, and to the mesmerizing creatures that may frolic there.</b><br><br>It came from the sea, from the lonely sea,<br>It came from the glittering sea.<br><br>In a small Massachusetts fishing village in August of 1817, dozens of citizens claimed to have seen an enormous sea serpent swimming off the coast. Terrified at first, the people of Gloucester eventually became quite accustomed to their new neighbor. Adventure seekers came from miles around to study the serpent and aggressively hunt it down, but the creature eluded capture. The Gloucester sea serpent was then, and remains now, a complete mystery. <br><br>Reviving the rhythms and tone of a traditional sea chanty, M.T. Anderson recounts this exhilarating sea adventure through the eyes of a little boy who secretly hopes for the serpent's survival. The author's captivating verse is paired with Bagram Ibatoulline's luminous paintings, created in the spirit of nineteenth-century New England maritime artists.</p><p>M.T. Anderson is the author of the celebrated picture book biography HANDEL, WHO KNEW WHAT HE LIKED, illustrated by Kevin Hawkes. He is also the author of several young adult novels, most recently FEED, a National Book Award Finalist and winner of the LOS ANGELES TIMES Book Prize. Considering the existence of sea serpents, he says, "For generations, fishermen in places as distant as New England and Norway took for granted the existence of long snakelike animals in the North Atlantic. It takes a peculiar kind of snobbery to believe that men who worked on the sea all their lives &#x2014; though illiterate &#x2014; were by nature superstitious, confused, and gullible. Unlike those people who have seen Bigfoot. Whew, what a bunch of lunatics!" M.T. Anderson currently serves on the faculty at Vermont College's MFA Program in Writing for Children.<br><br>Bagram Ibatoulline was born in Russia, graduated from the State Academic Institute of Arts in Moscow, and has worked in the fields of fine arts, graphic arts, mural design, and textile design. He is the illustrator of several children's picture books, including CROSSING by Philip Booth, named an American Library Association Notable Children's Book, THE ANIMAL HEDGE by Paul Fleischman, a PUBLISHERS WEEKLY Best Children's Book of the Year, and, most recently, HANA IN THE TIME OF THE TULIPS Deborah Noyes.Grade 3-5&#x2013;Rhyming text recounts the early-19th-century sighting of a large, mysterious sea serpent off the coast of Gloucester, MA. In keeping with the historical record, Anderson tells how the whole fishing village repeatedly viewed the creature until it disappeared with the onset of winter; the following summer, thinking they had sighted it far out on the sea, men set out to kill it, only to discover in the end that they had caught a huge mackerel. The narrator would seem to be a boy who runs through the streets announcing the arrival of the strange visitor. Ultimately, readers learn that an old man is recounting this boyhood ex perience for his grandchild. Formal, highly detailed paintings done in acrylic gouache are somber in tone and fill single or double pages. The shiny serpent is more a curiosity than a monstrous threat. Both verse and pictures create a vivid sense of long ago and far away. Yet, the story is a bit flat and somewhat confusing after the dead mackerel scene when the boy and some fishermen row out and view two creatures at play. Was this a dream or a bit of fantasy? All other references, including the author's concluding note on the history of this and other New England sea-serpent sightings, speak of just a single creature. The poetry reads well, and the story is a somewhat nostalgic recollection rather than a dramatic encounter. An evocative introduction to poetic narrative, local legends, or an exploration of a tantalizing subject.&#x2013; <i>Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When I was a teenager, still living at home, I listened to Janis&#x2019; music and read the article about her in Life. (She was a teenager, still living at home, then, too.) I never dreamt then that I might one day meet her. I really never dreamt then that we might become friends. That we have means a lot to me in a lot of different ways. So thanks, Janis. Thanks for everything. This one&#x2019;s for you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I</p><p>Charlie Sullivan never expected to meet Joe Steele in the service elevator of a cheap hotel only a couple of blocks from the Chicago Stadium. The AP stringer gaped at the Presidential candidate when Steele boarded on the second floor. Charlie had slipped the boss cook a buck, so he got on and off in the kitchen as he pleased.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re&#x2014;him!&#x201d; Charlie blurted when Joe Steele and one of his aides strode into the car. Long-standing tradition said that candidates stayed away from the convention till it nominated them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if it did.</p><p>Governor Franklin Roosevelt, Steele&#x2019;s main rival for the Democratic nomination in this summer of America&#x2019;s discontent, was still in the Executive Mansion in Albany. Charlie&#x2019;s older brother, Mike, who wrote for the <i>New York Post</i>, was covering him there. Roosevelt&#x2019;s operatives worked the Stadium hotels and bars just as hard as Joe Steele&#x2019;s, though. They glad-handed. They promised. They spread favors around.</p><p>&#x201c;I am him,&#x201d; the Congressman from California agreed. His smile didn&#x2019;t reach his eyes. Charlie Sullivan was a scrawny five-eight, but he overtopped Joe Steele by three inches. Steele stood straight, though, so you might not notice how short he was. That his henchman, a cold-looking fellow named Vince Scriabin, was about the same size also helped.</p><p>&#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What are you doing in town?&#x201d; Charlie asked.</p><p>The elevator door groaned shut. Joe Steele punched the button for 5. Then he scratched at his mustache. It was bushy and graying; he was in his early fifties. His hair, also iron-gray, gave a little at the temples. He had bad skin&#x2014;either he&#x2019;d had horrible pimples or he&#x2019;d got through a mild case of smallpox. His eyes were an interesting color, a yellow-brown that almost put you in mind of a hunting animal.</p><p>&#x201c;Officially, I&#x2019;m in Fresno,&#x201d; he said as the elevator lurched upward. That fierce, hawklike stare burned into Charlie. &#x201c;You might embarrass me if you wrote that I was here.&#x201d;</p><p>Vince Scriabin eyed Charlie, too, as if fitting him for a coffin. Scriabin also wore a mustache, an anemic one that looked all the more so beside Joe Steele&#x2019;s. He had wire-framed glasses and combed dark, greasy hair over a widening bald spot. People said he was very bad news. Except for the scowl, you couldn&#x2019;t tell by looking.</p><p>Joe Steele&#x2019;s stare, though less outwardly tough, worried Charlie more. Or it would have, if he&#x2019;d been on FDR&#x2019;s side. But he said, &#x201c;We need some changes&#x2014;need &#x2019;em bad. Roosevelt talks big, but I think you&#x2019;re more likely to deliver.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am.&#x201d; Joe Steele nodded. He wasn&#x2019;t a big man, but he had a big head. &#x201c;Four years ago, Hoover promised two chickens in every pot and two cars in every garage. And what did he give us? Two chickens in every garage!&#x201d; Despite the big mustache, Charlie saw his lip twist.</p><p>Charlie laughed as the service elevator opened. &#x201c;Good one, Congressman!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about me. I&#x2019;ll keep my trap shut.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t worrying.&#x201d; Joe Steele stepped out of the little car. &#x201c;Come on, Vince. Let&#x2019;s see what kind of deal we can fix with John.&#x201d; Scriabin followed him. The door groaned shut again. The elevator lurched up toward Charlie&#x2019;s seventh-floor room.</p><p>His mind whirred all the way there. You couldn&#x2019;t find a more common name than John. But John Nance Garner, the Speaker of the House from Texas, also had a Presidential yen, and controlled his state&#x2019;s delegation as well as other votes from the Deep South. He wasn&#x2019;t likely to land the top spot on the ticket. Swinging him one way or the other could get expensive for Steele or Roosevelt.</p><p>Roosevelt had never known a day&#x2019;s want in his life. His family went back to before New Amsterdam turned into New York. His cousin Theodore had been Governor ahead of him, and had served almost two full terms as President after the turn of the century.</p><p>Joe Steele was a different story. His folks got out of the Russian Empire and into America only a few months before he was born. He became a citizen well ahead of them. As a kid, he picked grapes under Fresno&#x2019;s hot sun, and few suns came hotter.</p><p>He hadn&#x2019;t been born Joe Steele. He&#x2019;d changed his name when he went from farm laborer to labor agitator. The real handle sounded like a drunken sneeze. Several relatives still wore it.</p><p>Not all prices were payable in cash, of course. John Nance Garner might want as much power as he could get if he couldn&#x2019;t be President. Veep? Supreme Court Justice? Secretary of War?</p><p>Charlie Sullivan laughed as he strode down the hall to the sweltering top-floor room. He wasn&#x2019;t just building castles in the air, he was digging out their foundations before he built them. Not only didn&#x2019;t he know what Garner wanted, he didn&#x2019;t know whether Joe Steele and Scriabin had been talking about him to begin with.</p><p>The first thing he did when he went inside was to pull the cord that started the ceiling fan spinning. The fan stirred the hot, humid air a little, but didn&#x2019;t cool it.</p><p>Chicago Stadium was just as bad. No, worse&#x2014;Chicago Stadium was packed full of shouting, sweating people. A handful of trains, restaurants, and movie houses boasted refrigerated air-conditioning. The new scientific marvel got you too cold in summer, as central heating made you sweat in January.</p><p>But air-conditioning didn&#x2019;t exist at the Chicago Stadium. Inside the massive amphitheater, you roasted as God had intended. If you walked around with an apple in your mouth, someone would stick a fork in you and eat you.</p><p>And too many Democrats knew more about politics than they did about Ivory or Palmolive or Mum. Some doused themselves in aftershave to try to hide the problem. The cure might have been worse than the disease. Or, when you remembered how some of the other politicos smelled, it might not.</p><p>Charlie eyed the Remington portable that sat on a nightstand by the bed. It didn&#x2019;t quite lie about its name; he&#x2019;d lugged it here without rupturing himself. He sure wouldn&#x2019;t haul it to the convention floor, though. If he dropped it out the window, it would make a big hole in the sidewalk. And it would drive any passerby into the ground like a hammer driving a nail.</p><p>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; he said. For the floor, he had notebooks and pencils. Reporters would have covered Lincoln&#x2019;s nomination in Chicago the same way. They would have given their copy to telegraphers the same way, too, though he could also phone his in.</p><p>He could make a splash if he reported that Joe Steele was in town to fight for the nomination in person. He suspected his brother would have. Mike liked FDR more than Charlie did.</p><p>Whoever nabbed the Democratic nomination this summer would take the oath of office in Washington next March. The Republicans were dead men walking. Poor stupid bastards, they were the only ones who didn&#x2019;t know it.</p><p>They&#x2019;d elected Herbert Hoover in a landslide in 1928. When Wall Street crashed a year later, the land slid, all right. Hoover meant well. Even Charlie Sullivan, who couldn&#x2019;t stand him, wouldn&#x2019;t have argued that. No doubt the fellow who&#x2019;d rearranged the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic</i> after it hit the iceberg did, too.</p><p>No, when your name stuck to the shantytowns full of people who had nowhere better to live, you wouldn&#x2019;t win a second term. Yet the Republican faithful had gathered here in June to nominate him again. Charlie wondered if they&#x2019;d bothered looking outside of Chicago Stadium before they did.</p><p>He stuck a straw hat on his head and rode down on the regular elevator. His clothes would stick to him by the time he got to the Stadium. Why give them a head start by taking the stairs?</p><p>No sign of Joe Steele in the lobby. Through air blue with cigarette smoke, Charlie did spot Vince Scriabin and Lazar Kagan, another of Steele&#x2019;s wheeler-dealers, bending the ear of some corn-fed Midwestern politician. He was pretty sure Scriabin saw him, too, but Steele&#x2019;s man never let on. Scriabin wasn&#x2019;t anyone you&#x2019;d want to play cards against.</p><p>Lighting a Chesterfield of his own, Charlie hurried west along Washington Boulevard toward the Chicago Stadium. He went by Union Park on the way. An old man sat on a park bench, tossing crumbs to pigeons and squirrels. Maybe he was making time go by. Then again, maybe he was hunting tonight&#x2019;s supper.</p><p>Charlie didn&#x2019;t look behind him when he tossed away his cigarette butt. Somebody would pick it up. You didn&#x2019;t want to take a man&#x2019;s pride, watching him do something like that. He wouldn&#x2019;t want you to see what he was reduced to, either.</p><p>Two ragged men slept under the trees. A bottle lay near one. By that, and by his stubble, he might have been sleeping on the grass for years. The other guy, who used a crumpled fedora for a pillow, was younger and neater. If he didn&#x2019;t have some kind of hard-luck story to tell, Charlie would have been amazed.</p><p>He also didn&#x2019;t look back at a thirtyish woman who gave him the eye. Some gals thought they had no better way to get by. It wasn&#x2019;t as if Charlie had never seen the inside of a sporting house. This poor, drab sister only gave him the blues, though.</p><p>He walked past a tailor&#x2019;s shop with a GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! sign in the window. Next door stood a shuttered bank. Close to forty banks had gone under in a local panic earlier in the year. They wouldn&#x2019;t be the last, either. These days, Charlie kept his money under his mattress. Thieves with masks seemed a smaller risk than the ones who wore green eyeshades.</p><p>Chicago Stadium was the biggest indoor arena in the country. The red-brick pile had a gently curving roofline. Lots of American flags flew from it any day of the week. With the convention there, they&#x2019;d draped it with so much red-white-and-blue bunting, it might as well have been gift-wrapped.</p><p>Cops and reporters and politicians milled around outside. Charlie thought of the line Will Rogers used to fracture audiences all over the country: <i>I am not a member of any organized political party. I am a Democrat.</i> The scene here lived up to, or down to, it all too well.</p><p>&#x201c;Press pass,&#x201d; a flatfoot growled at him.</p><p>&#x201c;For Chrissake, Eddie,&#x201d; Charlie said&#x2014;they&#x2019;d had coffee and donuts together plenty of times when he wrote for a Chicago paper.</p><p>&#x201c;Press pass,&#x201d; Eddie repeated. &#x201c;I gotta log that I&#x2019;m doin&#x2019; it for everybody.&#x201d; A disgusted look on his face, he showed a notebook of his own. Bureaucrats were taking over the world.</p><p>Charlie displayed the press pass. The cop scribbled and waved him on. The first thing he saw when he got inside was Huey Long, as comfortable as anyone could be in there with a white linen suit and a blue silk shirt, laying down the law to someone much bigger in an undertaker&#x2019;s suit of black wool. Listening to Huey made the man even less happy than baking in that outfit.</p><p>Whenever Charlie saw the Kingfish, lines about the jawbone of an ass jumped into his mind. Long made such an easy target. He couldn&#x2019;t possibly be as big a buffoon as he seemed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. could he?</p><p>A loud brass band blaring away and a demonstration much less spontaneous than it looked turned the floor to chaos. The great state of Texas&#x2014;as if there could be any other kind at a convention&#x2014;had just nominated its favorite son, John Nance Garner. No, it had placed his name in nomination. No, it had proudly placed his name in nomination. People seeking clear English at a gathering like this commonly needed to pay a sin tax on account of their leaders&#x2019; syntax.</p><p>If a demonstration got big enough and rowdy enough, it could sweep previously undecided delegates along in its wake. It could, yes, but the odds were poor, especially at the Democrats&#x2019; national clambake. The Democrats still hung on to the two-thirds rule.</p><p>Two delegates out of three had to agree on the Presidential candidate. If they didn&#x2019;t, the Democrats had no candidate. <i>Will Rogers isn&#x2019;t kidding,</i> Charlie thought as the demonstration began to lose steam.</p><p>The two-thirds rule had been around a long time. In 1860, the Democratic Party fractured because Stephen Douglas couldn&#x2019;t get over the hump. That let Lincoln win with a plurality far from a majority. Secession and civil war soon followed.</p><p>One might think that memories of such a disaster would scuttle the rule. One might, but one would be wrong. Just eight years earlier, in 1924, the Donkeys needed 103 ballots to nominate John W. Davis. By the time they got done, he was a national laughingstock. Calvin Coolidge walloped him in November.</p><p>The only Democratic President this century was Woodrow Wilson. He won the first time because Teddy Roosevelt&#x2019;s revolt split the GOP, and&#x2014;barely&#x2014;got reelected when he said he&#x2019;d keep America away from the Great War&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a promise he danced on less than a year later. Aside from that, the Democrats might as well have been short-pants kids swinging against Lefty Grove.</p><p>But they&#x2019;d win this time. They couldn&#x2019;t very well not win this time. They might pluck Trotsky out of Red Russia and run him against Hoover. They&#x2019;d win anyway, probably in a walk.</p><p>Somebody from Wisconsin was making a speech for Joe Steele. Why Wisconsin? It had to come down to courting delegates. &#x201c;Joe Steele has a plan for this country! Joe Steele will set this country right!&#x201d; the Congressman on the podium shouted.</p><p>People yelled themselves hoarse. Joe Steele did have a plan: a Four Year Plan, straightening things out through his first term. And Franklin D. Roosevelt offered the American people a New Deal, one he claimed would be better than the bad old deal they had now.</p><p>Hoover had no plan. Hoover stood for the old deal that had left the country in the ditch. He was making it up as he went along. He didn&#x2019;t even bother pretending he wasn&#x2019;t. He was about as political as a pine stump. No wonder he wouldn&#x2019;t win.</p><p>When the guy from the great state of Wisconsin proudly placed the name of Joe Steele in nomination for the office of President of the United States of America, the place went nuts. Confetti and straw hats flew. A new brass band did terrible things to &#x201c;California, Here I Come.&#x201d; People snake-danced through the aisles screaming, &#x201c;Joe Steele! Joe Steele! Joe Steele!&#x201d;</p><p>Not everybody got caught up in the orchestrated frenzy. Big Jim Farley kept the New York delegation in line for Governor Roosevelt. He was FDR&#x2019;s field boss, the way Vince Scriabin was for Joe Steele.

At its heart, <i>The Enchantress of Florence</i> is about the power of story--whether it is the imagined life of a Mughal queen, or the devastating secret held by a silver-tongued Florentine. Make no mistake, it is Rushdie who is the true "enchanter" of this story, conjuring readers into his gilded fairy tale from the very first sentence: "In the day's last light the glowing lake below the palace-city looked like a sea of molten gold." At once bawdy, gorgeous, gory, and hilarious, <i>The Enchantress of Florence</i> is a study in contradiction, highlighted in its barbarian philosopher-king who detests his bloodthirsty heritage even while he carries it out. Full of rich sentences running nearly the length of a page, Rushdie's 10th novel blends fact and fable into a challenging but satisfying read. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br><br>Salman Rushdie is the author of nine previous novels: <i>Grimus; Midnight&#x2019;s Children </i>(which was awarded the Booker Prize in 1981 and, in 1993, was judged to be the &#x201c;Booker of Bookers,&#x201d; the best novel to have won that prize in its first twenty-five years); <i>Shame</i> (winner of the French Prix de Meilleur Livre Etranger); <i>The Satanic Verses</i> (winner of the Whitbread Prize for Best Novel); <i>Haroun and the Sea of Stories </i>(winner of the Writers Guild Award); <i>The Moor&#x2019;s Last Sigh </i>(winner of the Whitbread Prize for Best Novel); <i>The Ground Beneath Her Feet </i>(winner of the Eurasian section of the Commonwealth Prize); <i>Fury</i> (a New York Times Notable Book); and <i>Shalimar the Clown </i>(a Time Book of the Year).

Told through a series of interviews with at least a dozen characters, Coelhos tale is perfect for the audiobook format.

The toxic rivalry between China and Japan, two Asian giants consumed with endless history wars and ruled by entrenched political dynasties, is threatening to upend the peace underwritten by Pax Americana since World War II.&nbsp;Combined with Donald Trump&#x2019;s disdain for America&#x2019;s old alliances and China's own regional ambitions, east Asia is entering a new era of instability and conflict.&nbsp;If the United States laid the postwar foundations for modern Asia, now the anchor of the global economy, <i>Asia&#x2019;s Reckoning </i>reveals how that structure is falling apart.<br><br>With unrivaled access to archives in the United States and Asia, as well as to many of the major players in all three countries, Richard McGregor has written a tale that blends the tectonic shifts in diplomacy with bitter domestic politics and the personalities driving them. It is a story not only of an overstretched America, but also of the rise and fall and rise of the great powers of Asia. The about-turn of Japan&#x2014;from a colossus seemingly poised for world domination to a nation in inexorable decline in the space of two decades&#x2014;has few parallels in modern history, as does the rapid rise of China&#x2014;a country whose military is now larger than those of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and southeast Asia's combined.<br><br>The confrontational course on which China and Japan are set is no simple spat between neighbors: the United States would be involved on the side of Japan&nbsp;in any military conflict between the two countries. The fallout would be an economic tsunami, affecting manufacturing centers, trade routes, and political capitals on every continent. Richard McGregor&#x2019;s book takes us behind the headlines of his years reporting as the <i>Financial Times</i>&#x2019;s Beijing and Washington bureau chief to show how American power will stand or fall on its ability to hold its ground in Asia.</p><p><b>Richard McGregor</b> is a journalist and an author with extensive experience in reporting from east Asia and Washington. A 2015 fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C., his work has appeared in the <i>International Herald Tribune</i> and <i>Foreign Policy</i> and he has appeared on the <i>Charlie Rose</i> show, the BBC, and NPR. His previous book, <i>The Party,</i> won numerous awards, including the 2011 Asia Society book of the year and the Asian book of the year prize from Japan&#x2019;s <i>Mainichi Shimbun</i>.There is no shortage of scenarios in which America&#x2019;s postwar world comes under challenge and starts to crack. It could take the form of a draining showdown with Islamist radicals in the Middle East, a conflict with Russia that engulfs Europe, or a one-on-one superpower naval battle with China. Soon after his election, Donald Trump finished his first conversation as president-elect with Barack Obama at the White House fretting about the threat from a nuclear-armed North Korea.<br> &nbsp;<br> In daily headlines, the jousting between China and Japan can&#x2019;t compete with the medieval violence of ISIS or the outsize antics of Vladimir Putin or threats from tyrants like Kim Jong Un. The rivalry between the two countries has festered, by some measures, for centuries, giving it a quality that lets it slip on and off the radar. After all, China and Japan, according to the conventional wisdom, are at their core practical nations with pragmatic leaders.<br> &nbsp;<br> The two countries, along with Taiwan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia, sit at the heart of the global economy. The iPhones, personal computers, and flat-screen televisions in electronic shops around the world; most of the mass-produced furniture and large amounts of the cheap clothing that fill shopping centers in the United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom; a vast array of industrial goods that consumers are scarcely aware of, from wires and valves to machine parts and the like&#x2014;all of them, one way or another, are sourced through the supply chains anchored by Asia&#x2019;s two giants. With so much at stake, how could they possibly come to blows? <br> &nbsp;<br> China and Japan&#x2019;s thriving commercial ties, one of the largest two-way trade relationships in the world, though, have failed to forge a closer political bond. In recent years, the relationship has taken on new and dangerous dimensions for both countries, and for the United States as well, an ally of Japan&#x2019;s that it has signed a treaty to defend. Far from exorcising memories of the brutal war between them that began in the early 1930s and lasted more than a decade, Japan and China are caught in a downward spiral of distrust and ill will. There has been the occasional thawing of tension and the odd uptick in diplomacy in the seventy years since the end of the war. Men and women of goodwill in both countries have dedicated their careers to improving relations. Most of these efforts, however, have come to naught.<br> &nbsp;<br> Asia&#x2019;s version of the War of the Roses is being fought on multiple battlefields: on the high seas over disputed islands; in capitals around the world as each tries to convince partners and allies of the other&#x2019;s infamy; and in the media, in the relentless, self-righteous, and scorching exchanges over the true account and legacy of the Pacific War. The clash between Japan and China on this issue echoes a conversation between two Allied prisoners of war in Richard Flanagan&#x2019;s garlanded novel set on the Burma Railway in 1943, <i>The Narrow Road to the Deep North</i>. &#x201c;Memory is the true justice, sir,&#x201d; a soldier says to his superior officer, explaining why he wants to hold on to souvenirs of their time in a Japanese internment camp. &#x201c;Or the creator of new horrors,&#x201d; the officer replies.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Europe, an acknowledgment of World War II&#x2019;s calamities helped bring the Continent&#x2019;s nations together in the aftermath of the conflict. In east Asia, by contrast, the war and its history have never been settled, politically, diplomatically, or emotionally. There has been little of the introspection and statesmanship that helped Europe to heal its wounds. Even the most basic of disagreements over history still percolate through day-to-day media coverage in Asia more than seventy years later, in baffling, insidious ways. Open a Japanese newspaper in 2017, and you might read of a heated debate about whether Japan invaded China, something that is only an issue because conservative Japanese still insist that their country was fighting a war of self-Defense in the 1930s and 1940s. Peruse the state-controlled press in China, and you will see the Communist Party drawing legitimacy from its heroic defeat of Japan, though in truth, Chiang Kai-shek&#x2019;s Nationalists carried the burden of fighting the invaders, while the Communists mostly preserved their strength in hinterland hideouts. Scant recognition is given to the United States, who fought the Japanese for years before ending the conflict with two atomic bombs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although the United States and Japan are for the moment firm allies, the trilateral relationship among Washington, Tokyo, and Beijing has been fraught and complex in ways that are little understood and appreciated, often even inside the countries themselves. Each of the three, China, Japan, and the United States, at different times has tried to use one of the others to gain an ascendancy in regional diplomacy in the last century. Each at different times has felt betrayed by the others. All have tried to leverage their relations with one of the others at the expense of the third. In that respect, the relationship is like a geopolitical version of the scene in the movie <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> in which a trio of antagonists all simultaneously point guns at one another, creating a circle of dangerous, cascading threats.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the east Asian version of this scenario, the United States has its arsenal trained on China. China, in turn, menaces Japan and the United States. In ways that are rarely noticed, Japan completes the triangle with its hold over the United States. If Tokyo were to lose faith in Washington and downgrade its alliance or trigger a conflict with Beijing, the effect would be the same: to upend the postwar system. In this trilateral game of chicken, only one of the parties needs to fire its weapons for all three to be thrown into war. Put another way, if China is the key to Asia, then Japan is the key to China, and the United States the key to Japan.<br> &nbsp;<br> I left Tokyo for Hong Kong and China in 1995 after a five-year posting as a newspaper correspondent, soon after Japan&#x2019;s then prime minister issued a heartfelt apology for the war. At the time, I remember feeling relieved that the issue seemed to have finally been put to rest. The history wars, though, far from ending, were just getting started. Over the ensuing two decades, under pressure from the Chinese Communist Party and abetted by Japanese revisionists, the same old issues have remained stuck on the front lines of regional politics.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like east Asia more generally, the story of Japan and China is one of stunning economic success and dangerous political failure. China in particular has a whiff of the Balkans, where many young people have a way of vividly remembering wars they never actually experienced. A sense of revenge, of unfinished business, lingers in the system.<br> &nbsp;<br> It may not require a war, of course, to deliver the last rites for Pax Americana. Washington could simply turn its back on the world under an isolationist president, a president, in other words, who simply did what Donald Trump promised to do on the campaign trail. America could also slip into unruly decline, with a weaker economy resulting in bits of empire, no longer financially sustainable, dropping off here and there.<br> &nbsp;<br> Alternatively, of course, Pax Americana in Asia could survive, with a resilient U.S. economy and refreshed alliances robust enough to hold off an indebted and internally focused China. Indeed, it is unlikely that the United States will leave the region quietly. As Michael Green, a former U.S. government official, notes, over more than a century in the Asia- Pacific, Washington has beaten back quests for regional dominance &#x201c;from the European powers, Imperial Japan and Soviet Communism.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The specter of a renewed Sinocentric order in Asia, though, is upending the regional status quo for good, whatever path the United States might take. Geopolitically, the three countries have increasingly become two, with Japan aligning itself more tightly with the United States than at any time in the seven decades&#x2013;plus since the war. China, too, has changed. Once, Beijing begrudgingly accepted America&#x2019;s Asian alliances as a tool to keep the Soviets at bay and stabilize the region. Since the end of the cold war, its attitude has shifted, from frustration with America&#x2019;s enduring military footprint in Asia to outright rejection of the alliances as &#x201c;cold war relics&#x201d; that threaten China&#x2019;s security. As its power has grown, China has begun building a new regional order, with Beijing at the center in place of Washington. The battle lines are clear. For decades, the United States has set its forward defensive line against rival hegemons in the region in different places before establishing it firmly along and around the Japanese archipelago, where it stands today.</p><h2>The Pangs Of Love (Abacus Books)</h2><p>With her customary accuracy, Jane Gardam reveals the extraordinariness of ordinary people as she deals with the pangs of love- fulfilled or hopeless, sexual or spiritual, tortured or hilarious- in these eleven stories.Paraded here are ladies with a &#39;thing&#39; about vicars, strange events happening in ornate downstairs lavatories (and in ornate upstairs ones), and the English abroad, desperate and dotty. The glum and impossible Edna haunts the supermarket- and dispenses an unlikely kiss of life. The younger sister of Hans Christian Andersen&#39;s Little Mermaid declares her sibling &#39;very silly&#39; and turns her story on its tail, an old maid forms a curious liason with a tramp, and small moments of temptation fill hotel rooms as histories glance briefly off each other.</p><p></p><h2>Nation on the Take: How Big Money Corrupts Our Democracy and What We Can Do About It</h2><p><p>American democracy has become coin operated. Special interest groups increasingly control every level of government. The necessity of raising huge sums of campaign cash has completely changed the character of politics and policy making, determining what elected representatives stand for and how they spend their time. The marriage of great wealth and intense political influence has rendered our country unable to address our most pressing problems, from runaway government spending to climate change to the wealth gap. It also defines our daily lives: from the cars we drive to the air we breathe to the debt we owe.<br>In this powerful work of reportage, Wendell Potter and Nick Penniman, two vigilant watchdogs, expose legalized corruption and link it to the kitchen-table issues citizens face every day. Inciting our outrage, the authors then inspire us by introducing us to the army of reformers laying the groundwork for change, ready to be called into action. The battle plan for reform presented is practical, realistic, and concrete. No one-except some lobbyists and major political donors-likes business as usual, and this book intends to help forge a new army of reformers who are compelled by a patriotic duty to fight for a better democracy.<br>An impassioned, infuriating, yet ultimately hopeful call to arms, <i>Nation on the Take </i>lays bare the reach of moneyed interests and charts a way forward, toward the recovery of America's original promise.</p></p><p><p><b>Wendell Potter </b>is a senior analyst at the Center for Public Integrity, the senior fellow on health care at the Center for Media and Democracy, and a leading critic of the health insurance industry.

He was previously publisher of the<i> Washington Monthly </i>and director of the Huffington Post Investigative Fund. </p><p>Both authors live in the D.C. area.</p><p>"Potter and Penniman show that our corrupt political campaign finance system, which is increasingly controlled by billionaires and special interests, is an issue that should concern all Americans." - Bernie Sanders</p><p>"There could be no more important or timely book than <i>Nation on the Take</i>. Potter and Penniman make a compelling case that moneyed interests have seized control of the levers of power in ways we haven&#x2019;t seen since the Gilded Age. This is a stirring guide for how we can work together to reclaim our democracy and reunify our country." &#x2015;Doris Kearns Goodwin</p><p>"Whether Republican, Democrat, or Independent, we are, first of all, Americans. This book makes a powerful case that dark money darkens our democracy, and we must rise and join as patriots to reclaim our cherished right to self-government." &#x2015;Senator Alan Simpson, (R-WY, 1979&#x2013;97)</p><p>"<i>Nation on the Take </i>is a timely and inspired book about a uniquely American problem. But Penniman and Potter don&#x2019;t merely draw our attention to the ways money dominates politics--they expertly show how the crisis connects with our daily lives and offer a path forward that includes people from all walks of life and all political persuasions." &#x2015;Arianna Huffington</p><p>"<i>Nation on the Take </i>is a tour de force, a work of immense importance in the seminal debate at the core of all debates: will our nation be sold to the highest bidder or will the American people reestablish the republic our founders intended. A gripping and frightening expos� of the crisis, along with profound yet practical suggestions to repair the dysfunction, Nation on the Take should be required reading for all who care about America." &#x2015;Jack Abramoff, author of CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: The Hard Truth about Washington Corruption from America&#x2019;s Most Notorious Lobbyist</p><p>"If you're among of the 90% of Americans who think our political system is broken, <i>Nation on the Take </i>is made for you. Wendell Potter &amp; Nick Penniman have compiled a fact-packed handbook for political reform: the nitty-gritty on how billionaires&#x2019; campaign contributions and corporate cash have captured both political parties and bought policies for the 1 percent; how each of us pays a price in our daily lives for the runaway political money game; and, most important, specific suggestions on how we can reform our broken system and get our democracy back on track." &#x2015;Hedrick Smith, former Washington bureau chief of for the New York Times and author of WHO STOLE THE AMERICAN DREAM?</p><p>"The biggest challenge surrounding the issue of politics and money is that so many recognize it is a problem but so few can articulate why and what we can do about it. Penniman and Potter have cut through the clutter and distilled the essence of the challenge in a way that should have people marching in the streets. They make a compelling case that Americans across the political spectrum, from MoveOn Democrats to Tea Party Republicans, should care about this issue because it is an existential threat to our very democracy." &#x2015;Mark McKinnon, former communications director advisor for George W. Bush</p><p>"This book is a rare achievement -- a profoundly serious analysis of our politics that is elegantly written, passionately argued, and convincingly detailed. It goes beyond the familiar 'the system is broken' rhetoric to make dramatically clear what's at stake for every citizen when government is run by a pay-as-you-go band of plutocrats. Moreover, the pieces of the solution are on the table if we find the will to put them back together. It is clear-eyed and direct about a subject that is too often wrapped in opaque policy-wonk prose." &#x2015;Landon Jones, former managing editor of People Magazine</p><p>"There is no doubt that our democracy is in crisis. And when democracy is in crisis, so is our economic system. As Nation on the Take so adeptly shows, Big Money and crony capitalism go hand in hand. Any entrepreneur looking to make it today is up against a rigged game -- one that is not just rigged on behalf of billionaire political donors, but also billion-dollar corporations that want to make sure the rules benefit them at the expense of everything and everyone else. This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to de-rig the economy and restore the power of everyday citizens." &#x2015;Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben &amp; Jerry's</p></p><h2>Savor the Moment (The Brides Quartet, Book 3)</h2><p>Wedding cake baker Laurel McBane appreciates a strong, intelligent man--a man just like Parker&#39;s older brother, Delaney.

Roberts has more than 400 million copies of her books in print.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br><p>Alone, with Norah Jones whispering through the iPod,Laurel transformed a panel of fondant into a swatch of elegant,edible lace. She didn&#x2019;t hear the music, used it more to fill the airthan as entertainment while she painstakingly pieced the completedpanel onto the second tier of four. </p><p>She stepped back to eye the results, to circle, to search for flaws.Vows&#x2019; clients expected perfect, and that&#x2019;s exactly what she intendedto deliver. Satisfied, she nodded, and picked up a bottle of water tosip while she stretched her back. </p><p>&#x201c;Two down, two to go.&#x201d; </p><p>She glanced toward the board where she&#x2019;d pinned various samplesof antique lace, and the final sketched design for the cake Fridayevening&#x2019;s bride had approved. </p><p>She had three more designs to complete: two for Saturday, onefor Sunday&#x2014;but that was nothing new. June at Vows, the weddinga nd event business she ran with her friends, was prime time.</p><p>In a handful of years, they&#x2019;d turned an idea into a thriving enterprise.Sometimes just a little too thriving, she mused, which waswhy she was making fondant lace at nearly one in the morning. </p><p>It was a very good thing, she decided. She loved the work. </p><p>They all had their passions. Emma had the flowers, Mac the photography,Parker the details. And she had the cakes. And the pastries,she thought, and the chocolates. But the cakes stood as the crowningtouch. </p><p>She got back to it, began to roll out the next panel. Followinghabit, she&#x2019;d clipped her sunny blond hair up and back out of herway. Cornstarch dusted the baker&#x2019;s apron she wore over cottonpants and tee, and the slide-on kitchen shoes kept her feet as comfortableas possible after hours of standing. Her hands, strong fromyears of kneading, rolling, lifting, were capable and quick. As shebegan the next pattern, her sharp-featured, angular face set in seriouslines. </p><p>Perfection wasn&#x2019;t simply a goal when it came to her art. ForIcing at Vows it was a necessity. The wedding cake was more thanbaking and piping, sugar paste and filling. Just as the wedding photosMac took were more than pictures, and the arrangements andbouquets Emma created more than flowers. The details and schedulesand wishes Parker put together were, in the end, bigger thanthe sum of their parts. </p><p>Together, the elements became a once-in-a-lifetime event, andthe celebration of the journey two people chose to make together. </p><p>Romantic, certainly, and Laurel believed in romance. In theory,anyway. More, she believed in symbols and celebrations. And in areally fabulous cake. </p><p>Her expression softened into pleasure as she completed thethird tier, and her deep blue eyes warmed as she glanced over tosee Parker hovering in the doorway. </p><p>&#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you in bed?&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;Details.&#x201d; Parker circled a finger over her own head. &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;tsettle. How long have you been at this tonight?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Awhile. I need to finish it so it can set overnight. Plus I havethe two Saturday cakes to assemble and decorate tomorrow.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Want company?&#x201d; </p><p>They knew each other well enough that it was understood ifLaurel said no, there&#x2019;d be no off ense. And often, when deep in work,no was the answer. </p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I love the design.&#x201d; Parker, as Laurel had, circled the cake. &#x201c;Thedelicacy of the white on white, the interest of the diff erent heightsof each tier&#x2014;and the intricacy of each. They really do look like differentpanels of lace. Old-fashioned, vintage, that&#x2019;s our bride&#x2019;s theme.You&#x2019;ve nailed it with this.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to do pale blue ribbon around the pedestal,&#x201d; Laurelsaid as she started on the next panel. &#x201c;And Emma&#x2019;s going to scatterwhite rose petals at the base. It&#x2019;s going to be a winner.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The bride&#x2019;s been good to work with.&#x201d; </p><p>Comfortable in her pajamas, her long brown hair loose ratherthan in its work mode of sleek tail or smooth chignon, Parker puton the kettle for tea. One of the perks of running the business outof her home, and of having Laurel living there&#x2014;with Emma andParker right on the estate as well&#x2014;were these late-night visits. </p><p>&#x201c;She knows her mind,&#x201d; Laurel commented, choosing a tool toscallop the edges of the panel. &#x201c;But she&#x2019;s open to suggestion, and sofar hasn&#x2019;t been insane. If she makes it through the next twenty-fourthat way, she&#x2019;ll definitely earn Vows&#x2019; coveted Good Bride status.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;They looked happy and relaxed tonight at rehearsal, and that&#x2019;sa good sign.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Mmm-hmm.&#x201d; Laurel continued the pattern with precisely placedeyelets and dots. &#x201c;So, again, why aren&#x2019;t you in bed?&#x201d; </p><p>Parker sighed as she heated a little teapot. &#x201c;I think I was havinga moment. I was unwinding with a glass of wine out on my terrace.I could see Mac&#x2019;s place, and Emma&#x2019;s. The lights were on inboth houses, and I could smell the gardens. It was so quiet, sopretty. The lights went off &#x2014;Emma&#x2019;s first, and a little while after,Mac&#x2019;s. I thought how we&#x2019;re planning Mac&#x2019;s wedding, and thatEmma just got engaged. And all the times we played Wedding Day,the four of us, when we were kids. Now it&#x2019;s real. I sat there in thequiet and the dark, and found myself wishing my parents could behere to see it. To see what we&#x2019;ve done here, and who we are now.I got stuck.&#x201d; She paused to measure out tea. &#x201c;Between being sadthey&#x2019;re gone and being happy because I know they&#x2019;d be proud ofme. Of us.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I think about them a lot. We all do.&#x201d; Laurel continued to work.&#x201c;Because they were such an essential part of our lives, and becausethere are so many memories of them here. So I know what youmean by being stuck.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;d get a kick out of Mac and Carter, out of Emma andJack, wouldn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, they would. And what we&#x2019;ve done here, Parker? It rocks.They&#x2019;d get a kick out of that, too.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m lucky you were up working.&#x201d; Parker poured hot waterinto the pot. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve settled me down.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Here to serve. I&#x2019;ll tell you who else is lucky, and that&#x2019;s Friday&#x2019;sbride. Because this cake?&#x201d; She blew stray hair out of her eyes as shenodded smugly. &#x201c;It kicks major ass. And when I do the crown,angels will weep with joy.&#x201d; </p><p>Parker set the pot aside to steep. &#x201c;Really, Laurel, you need totake more pride in your work.&#x201d; </p><p>Laurel grinned. &#x201c;Screw the tea. I&#x2019;m nearly done here. Pour mea glass of wine.&#x201d; </p><p>In the morning, after a solid six hours&#x2019; sleep, Laurel got ina quick session at the gym before dressing for the workday. She&#x2019;dbe chained in her kitchen for the bulk of it, but before that routinebegan, there was the summit meeting that prefaced every event. </p><p>Laurel dashed downstairs from her third-floor wing to the mainlevel of the sprawling house, and back to the family kitchen whereMrs. Grady was putting a fruit platter together. </p><p>&#x201c;Morning, Mrs. G.&#x201d; </p><p>Mrs. Grady arched her eyebrows. &#x201c;You look feisty.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Feel feisty. Feel righteous.&#x201d; Laurel fisted both hands, flexed hermuscles. &#x201c;Want coff ee. Much.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Parker&#x2019;s taken the coff ee up already. You can take this fruit, andthe pastries. Eat some of that fruit. A day shouldn&#x2019;t start with aDanish.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am. Anyone else here yet?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Not yet, but I saw Jack&#x2019;s truck leave a bit ago, and I expectCarter will be along giving me the puppy eyes in hopes of a decentbreakfast.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get out of the way.&#x201d; Laurel grabbed the platters, balancingthem with the expertise of the waitress she&#x2019;d been once upona time. </p><p>She carried them up to the library, which now served as Vows&#x2019;conference room. Parker sat at the big table, with the coff ee serviceon the breakfront. Her BlackBerry, as always, remained at easyreach. The sleek ponytail left her face unframed, and the crispwhite shirt transmitted business mode as she sipped coff ee andstudied data on her laptop with midnight blue eyes Laurel knewmissed nothing. </p><p>&#x201c;Provisions,&#x201d; Laurel announced. She set the trays down, thentucked her chin-length swing of hair behind her ears before sheobeyed Mrs. Grady and fixed herself a little bowl of berries. &#x201c;Missedyou in the gym this morning. What time did you get up?&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Six, which was a good thing, since Saturday afternoon&#x2019;s bridecalled just after seven. Her father tripped over the cat and may havebroken his nose.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Uh-oh.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s worried about him, but nearly equally worried abouthow he&#x2019;s going to look for the wedding, and in the photographs.I&#x2019;m going to call the makeup artist to see what she thinks can bedone.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Sorry about the FOB&#x2019;s bad luck, but if that&#x2019;s the biggest problemthis weekend, we&#x2019;re in good shape.&#x201d; </p><p>Parker shot out a finger. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t jinx it.&#x201d; </p><p>Mac strolled in, long and lean in jeans and a black T-shirt.&#x201c;Hello, pals of mine.&#x201d; </p><p>Laurel squinted at her friend&#x2019;s easy smile and slumberous greeneyes. &#x201c;You had morning sex.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I had stupendous morning sex, thank you.&#x201d; Mac poured herselfcoff ee, grabbed a muffin. &#x201c;And you?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Bitch.&#x201d; </p><p>With a laugh, Mac dropped down in her chair, stretched outher legs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take my morning exercise over your treadmill andBowflex.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Mean, nasty bitch,&#x201d; Laurel said and popped a raspberry. </p><p>&#x201c;I love summer when the love of my life doesn&#x2019;t have to get upand out early to enlighten young minds.&#x201d; She opened her own laptop.&#x201c;Now I&#x2019;m primed, in all possible ways, for business.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Saturday afternoon&#x2019;s FOB may have broken his nose,&#x201d; Parkertold her. </p><p>&#x201c;Bummer.&#x201d; Mac&#x2019;s brow creased. &#x201c;I can do a lot with Photoshopif they want me to&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s kind of a cheat. What is, is&#x2014;and itmakes an amusing memory. In my opinion.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see what the bride&#x2019;s opinion is once he gets back fromthe doctor.&#x201d; Parker glanced over as Emma rushed in. </p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not late. There are twenty seconds left.&#x201d; Black curls bouncing,she scooted to the coff ee station. &#x201c;I fell back to sleep. After.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I hate you, too,&#x201d; Laurel muttered. &#x201c;We need a new rule.No bragging about sex at business meetings when half of us aren&#x2019;tgetting any.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Seconded,&#x201d; Parker said immediately. </p><p>&#x201c;Aww.&#x201d; Laughing, Emma scooped some fruit into a bowl. </p><p>&#x201c;Saturday afternoon&#x2019;s FOB may have a broken nose.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Aww,&#x201d; Emma repeated, with genuine concern at Mac&#x2019;sannouncement. </p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll deal with it when we have more details, but however itturns out, it really falls to Mac and me. I&#x2019;ll keep you updated,&#x201d;Parker said to Mac. &#x201c;Tonight&#x2019;s event. All out-of-town attendants,relatives, and guests have arrived. The bride, the MOB, and theattendants are due here at three for hair and makeup. The MOGhas her own salon date and is due by four, with the FOG. FOB willarrive with his daughter. We&#x2019;ll keep him happy and occupied untilit&#x2019;s time for the formal shots that include him. Mac?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The bride&#x2019;s dress is a beaut. Vintage romance. I&#x2019;ll be playingthat up.&#x201d; </p><p>As Mac outlined her plans and timetable, Laurel rose for a secondcup of coff ee. She made notes here and there, continued to doso when Emma took over. As the bulk of Laurel&#x2019;s job was complete,she&#x2019;d fill in when and where she was needed. </p><p>It was a routine they&#x2019;d perfected since Vows had gone fromconcept to reality. </p><p>&#x201c;Laurel,&#x201d; Parker said. </p><p>&#x201c;The cake&#x2019;s finished&#x2014;and a wowzer. It&#x2019;s heavy, so I&#x2019;ll need helpfrom the subs transferring it to reception, but the design doesn&#x2019;trequire any on-site assembly. I&#x2019;ll need you to do the ribbon andwhite rose petals, Emma, once it&#x2019;s transferred, but that&#x2019;s it until it&#x2019;stime to serve. They opted against a groom&#x2019;s cake, and went for aselection of mini pastries and heart-shaped chocolates. They&#x2019;redone, too, and we&#x2019;ll serve them on white china lined with lace doiliesto mirror the design of the cake. The cake table linen is paleblue, eyelet lace. Cake knife and server, provided by the B and G.They were her grandmother&#x2019;s so we&#x2019;ll keep our eye on them. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be working on Saturday&#x2019;s cakes most of today,but should be freed up by four if anyone needs me. During the lastset, the subs will put leftover cake in the take-away boxes and tiethem with blue ribbon we&#x2019;ve had engraved with the B and G&#x2019;snames, and the date. Same goes if there are any leftover chocolatesor pastries. Mac, I&#x2019;d like a picture of the cake for my files. I haven&#x2019;tdone this design before.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Check.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And Emma, I need the flowers for Saturday night&#x2019;s cake. Canyou drop them off to me when you come to dress today&#x2019;s event?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No problem.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;On the personal front?&#x201d; Mac lifted a hand for attention. &#x201c;Noone&#x2019;s mentioned that my mother&#x2019;s latest wedding is tomorrow, inItaly. Which is, thankfully, many, many miles away from our happyhome here in Greenwich, Connecticut. I got a call from her justafter five this morning, as Linda doesn&#x2019;t get the concept of timezones&#x2014;and, well, let&#x2019;s face it, doesn&#x2019;t give a shit anyway.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you just let it ring?&#x201d; Laurel demanded, even asEmma reached over to rub Mac&#x2019;s leg in sympathy. </p><p>&#x201c;Because she&#x2019;d just keep calling back&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m trying to dealwith her. On my terms for a change.&#x201d; Mac raked her fingersthrough the bold red of her gamine cap of hair. &#x201c;There were, asexpected, tears and recriminations, as she&#x2019;s decided she wants methere. As opposed to a week ago, when she didn&#x2019;t. Since I have nointention of hopping on a plane, particularly when I have an eventtonight, two tomorrow, and another on Sunday, to see her get marriedfor the fourth time, she&#x2019;s not speaking to me.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;If only it would last.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Laurel,&#x201d; Parker murmured. </p><p>&#x201c;I mean it. You got to give her a piece of your mind,&#x201d; she remindedParker. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t. I can only let it fester.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Which I appreciate,&#x201d; Mac said. &#x201c;Sincerely. But as you can see,I&#x2019;m not in a funk, I&#x2019;m not swimming in guilt or even marginallypissed off . I think there&#x2019;s an advantage to finding a guy who&#x2019;s sensible,loving, and just really solid. An advantage over and abovereally terrific morning sex. Every one of you has been on my sidewhen I&#x2019;ve had to deal with Linda, you&#x2019;ve tried to help me throughher demands and basic insanity. I guess Carter just helped tip thescales, and now I can deal with it. I wanted to tell you.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d have morning sex with him myself, just for that.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Hands off , McBane. But I appreciate the sentiment. So.&#x201d; Sherose. &#x201c;I want to get some work done before I need to focus on today&#x2019;sevent. I&#x2019;ll swing by and get some shots of the cake.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Hang on, I&#x2019;ll go with you.&#x201d; Emma pushed up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back withthe team shortly&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ll drop the flowers off for you, Laurel.&#x201d; </p><p>When they&#x2019;d gone, Laurel sat another moment. &#x201c;She reallymeant it.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes, she really did.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And she&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; Laurel took a last moment to sit back and relaxwith her coff ee. &#x201c;Carter&#x2019;s the one who turned the key in the lock.I wonder what it&#x2019;s like to have a man who can do that, can help thatway without pushing. Who can love you that way. I guess when itcomes down to it, I envy her that even more than the sex.&#x201d;</p><p>Shrugging, Laurel rose. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better get to work.&#x201d; </p><p>Laurel didn&#x2019;t have time to think about men over the nextcouple of days. She didn&#x2019;t have the time or the energy to thinkabout love and romance.

IRELAND: AN INTRODUCTION (James O'Reilly) <p>When I was a boy, I remember my father sitting, lost in thought and memory, in view of a painting in our American living room. That painting was of Torc Mountain rising above the Lakes of Killarney in County Kerry, Ireland, which was for my father, home. He always seemed unreachable in this state, but whether or not he was, it was clear to me that he was filled with a longing that I at least in part understood. I loved him then as he loved Ireland-hopelessly, with every fiber of my body. </p><p>So for me my father was Ireland itself, just as he was the Catholic Church, the essence of which he labored mightily to instill in me and my six brothers and sisters. (And of course in Ireland, the two are, as the saying goes, joined at the hip.) What then did my father, as Ireland, represent in these twin roles? </p><p>He embodied a love of learning, a love of scholarship, a love of exact speech, of moral laws, of hard work, of looking for and expecting goodness in others but not being surprised if it wasn't forthcoming, of storytelling and reading and music, of sly and lunatic humor. He had a wild streak of sacrifice and charity, a combination of St. Francislike gentleness and ayatollahlike fierceness. He lanced personal boils with self-denial, revered tradition and rules because they are the stone framework of civilization when the wolves of cruelty and hunger are at the door, as they have been for so much of Irish history, a framework that lasts long after the roof has burned and the residents hanged. My father made me want to be, well, a saint-because it was so transparently the goal and practice in his own life-and it seemed then as it seems now, that nothing else could be as important. What does being a saint mean? Being as close to your Maker as you possibly can, at all times, warts and nose hairs and terrible bleeding mistakes all. That was the gift of my father, and for me was and remains the gift of Ireland. </p><p>What does this have to do with modern Ireland? Ireland has changed so dramatically in recent years, you'd hardly recognize the place if you haven't been in a while, or if all you know of Ireland is what Uncle Paddy told you of his childhood. So intellectuals in Dublin may scoff at my characterization of Ireland, cynics in Belfast hoot with derision, geeks in Cork dismiss the bandwidth of my thinking, Eurotrash in Galway snort at my navete. They've seen the real Ireland and it doesn't look at all like the romanticized version sloshing over the gunwales of the vast Irish diaspora. The Catholic faith has eroded, the Church is in decline, the famine ships are ancient history, the rural culture is on its last legs, and everything Irish is nothing but a tourist gimmick. But sometimes those who have left, those who are filled with unspeakable longing, as my father was, have something correct to say. </p><p>Ireland has in it, in its soil and air and water and sun, something that for want of a better word is alchemical, that no other place on earth seems to have. This is not to say that other peoples don't love their native land as much or as well, or that ancient portals of feeling and wisdom don't exist the world over, not at all. It is just that whatever there is in Ireland is unique. Perhaps this is a genetic thing-my bias is suspect with a name like O'Reilly-but I don't think so. I think the genetic predisposition may be only to love Ireland a bit more fervently, but it is not responsible for the place Ireland holds open on the spectrum of human possibilities. Ireland, it seems to me, is an earth-bound zone between birth and death that has not been de-coupled from either human event, not by Celts, nor Catholics, nor Computers. In Ireland you can sense more clearly the form of your own life, the shape of the little corporal boat that carries you down the river to home and the Eternal. In other words, in Ireland, you can get pretty close to Heaven. </p><p>When my father died, we took him back to Kerry. He was borne on the shoulders of his grade school classmates to rest above Killarney in Aghadoe, in a sixth century cemetery with a breathtaking view of his beloved Lakes and, of course, Torc Mountain. My brothers and I filled in his grave, taking care with the skulls and bones of other relatives buried there. </p><p>When I visit now, especially when I visit my father's grave, and look out over the Kerry Mountains, I am still filled with longing for all the things humans long for. But the heart's home really is elsewhere...only in Ireland, you are closer to it than anywhere else.</p>&#34;Travelers&#39; Tales is a valuable addition to any pre-departure reading list.&#34;</p><h2>History of the Wars by Procopius - The Gothic War</h2><p>Procopius of Caesarea was born in approximately 500. He is generally considered to be the last major historian of the ancient world. His works have given us a unique and intimate account both of the Roman Military and its Emperor Justinian. A native of Caesarea in Palaestina Prima little else is known of his early life, and apart from assuming that he would have received a classical Greek Education the rest is deduction rather than based on known facts. In 527, the first year of Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I's reign, he became the adsessor (legal adviser) for Belisarius, Justinian's chief military commander who was then starting out on what would become a brilliant military career, initially in the East of the Empire. After early successes Belisarius was defeated in 531 at the Battle of Callinicum and recalled to the Empire&#x2019;s heart in Constantinople. Justinian was without doubt clever but cruel. When part of Constantinople rose against him in the Nika riots of January, 532, he sent Belisarius and his fellow general Mundo to repress them in a savage massacre in the Hippodrome &#x2013; witnessed by Procopius. The following year Procopius accompanied Belisarius on his victorious expedition against the Vandal kingdom in North Africa and took part in the capture of Carthage. Procopius remained in Northern Africa with Belisarius' successor, Solomon the Eunuch, when Belisarius returned to Constantinople. Procopius rejoined Belisarius for his campaign against the Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy and was there for the Gothic siege of Rome that lasted a year and nine days and ended in March, 538. He witnessed Belisarius' entry into the Gothic capital, Ravenna, in 540. However at some point in the next few years Procopius seems to have been moved away from working with Belisarius. When the latter was sent back to Italy in 544 to cope with a further outbreak of the war with the Goths, Procopius appears to have no longer been with Belisarius' staff. Procopius continued to record history and his works are both insightful and clear headed, distilling the complexities of the times into several classic books. His death is thought to have been around 560.</p><p></p><h2>Destiny in the Desert: The road to El Alamein - the Battle that Turned the Tide</h2><p>It was the British victory at the Battle of El Alamein in November 1942 that inspired one of Winston Churchill&#39;s most famous aphorisms: &#39;This is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end, but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning&#39;. And yet the significance of this episode remains unrecognised. In this thrilling historical account, Jonathan Dimbleby describes the political and strategic realities that lay behind the battle, charting the nail-biting months that led to the victory at El Alamein in November 1942. It is a story of high drama, played out both in the war capitals of London, Washington, Berlin, Rome and Moscow, and at the front in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Morrocco and Algeria and in the command posts and foxholes in the desert. Destiny in the Desert is about politicians and generals, diplomats, civil servants and soldiers. It is about forceful characters and the tensions and rivalries between them. Drawing on official records and the personal insights of those involved at every level, Dimbleby creates a vivid portrait of a struggle which for Churchill marked the turn of the tide - and which for the soldiers on the ground involved fighting and dying in a foreign land. Now available in paperback in time, Destiny in the Desert, which was shortlisted for the Hessell-Tiltman prize 2012-13, is required reading for anyone with an interest in the Desert War.</p><p>Jonathan Dimbleby is a writer, broadcaster and film-maker. He presents Any Questions? and Any Answers? for BBC Radio 4 and presented ITV&#39;s flagship weekly political program This Week for over ten years. In 2008 his five part series on Russia was broadcast by BBC 2 accompanied by his book, Russia - A Journey to the Heart of a Land and its People; other books include Charles: the Private Man, The Public Face and The Last Governor. His 2010 series An African Journey and 2011 series A South American Journey were both broadcast on BBC2.

Twenty years later Nietzsche was proclaiming the death of God as an event that had taken place long before, but was still unrealized. The modern crisis of belief has deep roots. Don Cupitt shows how the rise in our science-based, democractic industrial society, of historical criticism and of knowledge of other religions has over the centuries slowly eroded the traditional framework of doctrinal belief--leaving us, as it seems to many, free, alone, and disoriented. But there is another story, for Cupitt also shows a line of creative thinkers, from Pascal to Wittgenstein, responding to each new challenge as it has arisen. A new understanding of religion is emerging which Cupitt calls non-realist, for it is without dogma. Instead, Christianity is seen as a way, a spiritual path, and an ethic. Religion becomes more like an art, for it is a function of our primal capacity to generate stories, symbols, and meanings to live by.</p><p>Don Cupitt shows how the rise in our science-based, democractic industrial society, of historical criticism and of knowledge of other religions has over the centuries slowly eroded the traditional framework of doctrinal belief--leaving us, as it seems to many, free, alone, and disoriented.Don Cupitt is Senior Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge.</p><h2>LONE STAR : A History of Texas and the Texans</h2><p>Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans by Fehrenbach, T.R.. 8vo.</p><p><b>T.

He chronicled his service to the Church in two autobiographies, <i>Confessions of a Parish Priest</i> and <i>Furthermore!</i></p>Greeley follows his well-established pattern in his latest Nuala Anne McGrail novel. Although the prescient Nuala Anne and her loving&#x2014;if slightly bemused&#x2014;husband, Dermot Michael Coyne, are busy attempting to prevent bullies from overtaking the local parish school, they still manage to find time to solve a mystery involving their nanny&#x2019;s new love interest. When it appears someone is trying to kill young Finnbar Burke, Nuala Anne and Dermot, with the able assistance of Cardinal Blackie Ryan and a host of Wabash Avenue Irregulars, quietly tackle the case. As they wrestle with figurative and literal demons, their story is juxtaposed with the tale of a nineteenth-century Irish immigrant who became one of the first female physicians in the Chicago area and helped solved a perplexing medical mystery during a smallpox epidemic. Although Greeley does a nice job illuminating some little-known facts about Irish American history as he interweaves the past and the present, his penchant for stereotyping his characters detracts from the narrative flow. Still, dedicated Greeley fans will relish another cozy, feel-good visit with the zany McGrail-Coyne clan. --Margaret Flanagan</p><h2>Challenger (Star Trek, New Earth, Book 6)</h2><p>As the Enterprise prepares to return home from its mission defending the colonists, their relief ship arrives badly damaged and the crew must help with repairs while the colony faces its gravest challenge. Original.</p><p><p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> "How could threat vessels get so close without tripping our sensors?" </p><p> "What do you expect from me? Look at the monitors. Completely gamma-seized." </p><p> "Then we better saddle up and learn to ride blind." </p><p> The sci-deck of Starfleet Cruiser <i>Peleliu</i> stank and smoldered. Part of the carpet was on fire, but nobody was bothering with it. Hot damage crawled like parasites through the mechanics under the sensor boards' tripolymer skin. Burst connections caused tiny volcanoes of acid in ripped-open sheeting. A third of the pressure pads and readouts had quit working or were crying for damage control. </p><p> Nick Keller swiped his uniform's dirty sleeve across his forehead, bent over the sensor boards, and tried to focus his stinging eyes. A fleck of insulation hung from a wing of his briar-patch-brown hair and blocked part of his view. For an hour they'd fielded attacks from enemies they couldn't see, couldn't target, and hadn't expected. How had any hostiles known they were on their way out to Belle Terre? Or was this some new enemy that nobody in Starfleet or out at the colony even knew about yet? </p><p> The question went unanswered. Sensors couldn't see through the bath of gamma radiation spewed by a pulsing neutron star so far away that even working long-range sensors wouldn't have picked it up. </p><p> Beside him, Tim McAddis dribbled sweat from his pale forehead onto the sensor dials. His blond hair glistened with a frost of perspiration. "I'm used to seeing things a solar system away, not a lousy five hundred yards. Now that our deflectors are on full, we can't even pick up phantom data like before." </p><p> It was a hard thing for a science officer to admit. </p><p> Keller pressed a hand to McAddis's hunched shoulder. "Look at the bright side. You'll get the blame instead of me." </p><p> McAddis grinned nervously. "The mighty second mate stands defiant." </p><p> A knock on the cold-molded lattice grid near his knee got Keller's attention. He found the first officer's reassuring face peering up from the command deck seven feet below, through the lattice fence that prevented crewmen or tools from falling under the sci-deck rail. "What've you two got up there? How'd they come up on us?" </p><p> Without a good explanation, Keller knelt to meet him under the rail and handed over the unhelpful truth. "Derek, they must've cruised in cold. No engines. Coasting, like the old days of rocketry. We were looking for exhaust signatures, not solid objects. All I can figure is the bad guys are accustomed to blackout action and know how to maneuver on inertia. Without engines, they're really invisible." </p><p> "Mr. Hahn," the communications officer interrupted, "sickbay reports thirty casualties." </p><p> "How many dead?" Derek Hahn asked. </p><p> "They just said casualties. I don't think they want to tell us." </p><p> Kneeling up here in only a pretense of seclusion, Keller gripped the rail at the tremor in Tracy Chan's voice. Everybody was shaken badly. They weren't even sure yet how many of their shipmates were dead. Suj Sanjai at tactical had been killed in the first hit less than an hour ago. That grim hello had brought in critical seconds of attack before the <i>Peleliu</i> got its shields up. Since then, the minutes had been long and bitter, landing percussion after percussion on them from unseen foes who understood better than Starfleet how to fight during Gamma Night. </p><p> "Phasers direct aft," the captain ordered. "Fire!" </p><p> Both Keller and Hahn looked at the command deck. </p><p> Staccato phaser fire spewed from the aft array, at targets no one could see, jolting the ship much more than normal. That was the damage speaking. The cruiser convulsed under Keller's knee. </p><p> Keeping his voice low, he murmured, "What's he targeting? He can't possibly know where they are." </p><p> Hahn shook his head, but said nothing. He watched Captain Roger Lake, stalking the center deck. </p><p> From up here on the half-circle balcony, Keller clearly saw the command arena below except for the turbolift. The science and engineering balcony where he knelt rested on top of the lift's tube structure, a design meant to maximize use of the cruiser's support skeleton. Two narrow sets of ladder steps, one to his left and the other to his right, curved down to the command deck on either side of the lift doors. Below, Crewman Makarios at the helm and Ensign Hurley at nav both hunched over their controls, staring at the main viewscreen, which stubbornly showed them only a static field interrupted every twenty seconds or so by a grainy flash of open space, fed by McAddis's tedious attempts to clear the sensors. The largest screen on the bridge -- on any Starfleet bridge -- was their window to eternity. The two fellows at the helm were hoping for a lucky glimpse of the attackers, maybe get off a clean shot with full phasers. </p><p> To port of the helm the half-demolished tactical station was still unmanned, with Captain Lake's stocky form haunting it as he tried to keep one eye on the main screen. Why hadn't he called for somebody to replace Sanjai? Why was he so moody? </p><p> To starboard, Chan's communications console was the only board on the bridge that had so far evaded damage, either direct or repercussive. Everybody else was struggling just to make things work at half capacity. Those first hits had done some nasty work. </p><p> Up here the engineering console on the balcony's starboard side beeped madly, reporting dozens of damaged sites all over the ship, but there was no one to answer. The engineers had split for their own section as soon as the attack came, and behind him the environmental and life-support board went wanting too. Keller and McAddis were up here alone. </p><p> Almost alone. </p><p> The sci-deck offered a certain amount of privacy. Sound insulation and clever design of the ceiling shell prevented travel of much conversation from up here to the lower deck, where command conversations were also taking place. The two sections, then, could be functionally close, but not interrupt each other. Usually, Keller liked it up here. This was second-officer territory if ever there had been any. During this voyage, though, an added presence haunted the upper deck. </p><p> He glanced to his right. </p><p> There she was. That Rassua woman, Zoa, along for the haul. A cross between an ambassador and an inspector, she wasn't in Starfleet, but she was here most of the time anyway, fulfilling her mission of "determining whether the Federation is up the standards of the Rassua." </p><p> She stood on the upper deck as if someone had leaned an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus against the console, both legs braced, her gold face and thick hair in a waterfall of severe skinny plaits, her lined lips giving nothing away. In the months of travel, Keller had only heard her voice a couple of times. If she was any indication, the Rassua weren't talkative. </p><p> Dressed in woven strips of leather that left her heavily tattooed shoulders bare, Zoa was markedly disparate from the Starfleet crew in their black trousers and brick-red jackets. If only she had boots on. Instead, she wore only some kind of crisscross thong sandals with thick soles, allowing her two-inch toenails to curve down like a hawk's talons hooked over a branch. </p><p> And she never moved her face. Her blue-dot eyes followed the crew action here and below. It was like having a sphinx watch every move they made. Keller wished he could order her off the bridge. Roger Lake wanted her here. He liked showing off to an alien who was being courted by the Federation. The UFP wanted the Rassua alliance to guard their zenith borders. </p><p> So here she was, observing. If they got out of this, she'd have a real story for somebody back home. </p><p> Keller had hoped she'd get the hint and go below when the battle started, but apparently this was what she'd been waiting for all along and she wasn't about to leave. He tried to ignore her. His skull throbbed. </p><p> Derek Hahn reached u</p></p><h2>The Very Lazy Ladybug (My First Storybook)</h2><p>Ladybug is so lazy that she doesn&#39;t know how to fly.

Isobel enjoys traveling, photography, and wildlife.PreSchool-Grade 1-The ladybug of the title is so lethargic that she doesn't even know how to fly. She decides to look for a new sleeping spot, and, since her mobility is restricted, she latches on to a number of passing animals. As she soon finds out, a kangaroo is too bouncy, a monkey's incessant swinging makes her dizzy, and a tiger's roaring makes it too noisy to sleep. Finally, she thinks she's found the perfect spot-on the trunk of an elephant. However, the elephant sneezes and the ladybug is launched into the air and has to fly at last. The illustrations are done in bold, eye-catching colors, and the animals are very simply drawn and easily recognizable. The variety in the type reflects the action and movement of the animals. Children will enjoy acting out the tale as the ladybug looks for a quiet place to sleep.

This is a reprint of the 1988 hardcover edition. The original version was the runner-u for Breed Book of the Year in the 1988 Dog Writers&#39; of America competition. While Mrs. Roos is now gone, her legacy lives on in this book and in the many articles she wrote and the Collies she bred.All the truly great Collies I vividly recall had one attribute in common--class!<p>Maybe it is that undefinable element so often repeated (seven times) in in the Collie standard--expression! Class, expression, elegance and balance distinguish the really great ones that transcend beyond equal technical perfection of type and soundness as defined by any standard, written or pictured. The best Collie judges, whether all-breed judges as the late Alvea Rosenberg, or our better specialty judges of the past century, have not only adhered to the standard but have had the ability to recognize class and beauty. As a result, perhaps the most beautiful breed of dogs has evolved in the modern Collie.</p><p>But there is another and perhaps more important aspect of this beautiful and gentle breed of dogs. Collies instinctively love children and children love them. As a child, how I was fascinated by the stories of Albert Payson Terhune! I thought our own "farm type" Collie was wonderful, but with bits to eat and petting, I also lured the neighbor's purebred Collie to visit me. I don't know which one I liked most, but they both liked e. Have you ever seen a Collie that did not like children and would not tolerate their foolishness as well as protect them, if necessary, even from a spanking?</p><p>While to the child almost all Collies are loving and good natured, to the prowler or thief the Collie is a large, instinctively suspicious dog that will bark. This alone may deter the thief.</p><p>To almost everyone, the Collie is a beautiful dog, whether a show specimen or not. These qualities have endeared the Collie to the public in the past and have made it a popular breed in spite of new breeds and a shift from rural to urban life. Stephen J.

Sumptuous photography portrays the increasing fascination with hacienda architecture today, as evidenced by the movement to renovate classic adobe homes, the abundance of new hacienda designs, and the inspiration Spanish colonial architecture provides to homeowners, designers, and architects worldwide. The estate hacienda was traditionally the family home for Spanish nobles in the newly settled Mexican territories and included farmed land, orchards, stables, livestock, and servants. These extraordinary homes, many of which are owned by descendants of the original owners, are being meticulously preserved, or carefully transformed, into popular inns and tourist attractions. Today, the style is influencing residences throughout North America.With more than 250 photographs, Linda Leigh Paul presents the best haciendas, representing past and present designs: From large country estates to small adobe hideaways, the rugged beauty, rich color palette, and natural materials of the hacienda are brought to life in a book that is as delightful as a walk through the adobe arches and cool, tiled rooms of a Spanish colonial casa.</p><p>Linda Leigh Paul is the author of Cottages by the Sea, Coastal Retreats, Desert Retreats, Cottages on the Coast, The Cabin Book, Island Living, and Lakeside Living, all published by Universe."...Linda Leigh Paul highlights 25 dwellings that uphold their cultural influences.

Among his novels are Of Human Bondage, The Moon and Sixpence, and The Razor's Edge.</p>This third novel in the Amelia Peabody series once again takes the listener to Egypt and its ancient ruins. Who better than author/Egyptologist Elizabeth Peters to concoct a turn-of-the-century mystery in which humor, romance, and an archaeological dig come together. Susan O'Malley's narration is adequate. Amelia and her husband, Emerson, investigate the death of an antiquities dealer and the theft of a mummy case. Their son, Ramses, collects his own amusing evidence. The scenes and pace of the novel are kept intact, but the narration noticeably lacks the ethnic accents that enliven these stories.

Some she's bought, but many have been made for her by adoring fans and given to her as gifts. I don't make dragons, of course. But whenever circumstances allow, I do try to bring her American bacon, something she can't get easily in Ireland, and something which she has taught all her friends there to love, as well! I remember the first time I went to visit her, when she was still living in her old, much smaller but very homey, house. My husband and I arrived at the doorstep, and she immediately began bustling about, frying up some of the bacon we'd brought and sharing a lovely late breakfast with us before sending us off to the hotel for a nap. She made us dinner that night, too--the one and only time in my life that I've actually liked shrimp cocktail. Maybe that's because if you squint your eyes and look sideways, shrimp are kind of dragonlike, and I was eating them in the right company!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive EditorAnne McCaffrey received the 1999 Margaret A.

Wodehouse) was an English humorist and writer best known for his Jeeves and Blandings Castle novels. Educated at boarding schools, Wodehouse turned to writing at a young age, demonstrating great skill at humorous sketches and musical lyrics. He continued to write part-time while pursuing, at the behest of his father, a career in banking, and successfully contributed numerous pieces to Punch, Vanity Fair, and The Daily Express, among other publications. In addition to his literary work, Wodehouse was incorporated into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in recognition of his collaboration with Cole Porter on Anything Goes, his lyrics to the song Bill from Show Boat, and his work on the musicals Rosalie and The Three Musketeers.<p>While interned along with other British citizens in Germany during the Second World War, Wodehouse made a series of radio broadcasts for which he was accused of being a collaborator; and, although later cleared of the charges, he never returned to England. His work has influenced many other writers including Evelyn Waugh, Rudyard Kipling, J. K. Rowling, and John Le Carr?. P. G. Wodehouse died in 1975 at the age of 93.</p>Frederick Davidson may not be the best interpreter of P.G. Wodehouse's comic masterpieces, but he's not the worst and is assuredly the most active, with at least 25 Wodehouse titles under his belt. He is, in fact, one of the most popular and active readers in the general audiobook field. He reads with a dry British accent, low-key and almost drawling. His great weakness is that he enunciates all young women with the same breathy, indistinguishably vapid intonation. With men, on the other hand, he offers a wide interpretation, some quite funny as he portrays such personality traits as growling irascibility or stumbling befuddlement. Luckily for him here, there are few female characters. Author Wodehouse began publishing books in 1902 and died in 1975 after having been named a Knight of the British Empire. The present book first appeared in 1921 at a time when Wodehouse was at least as well known for his collaborative work in America as a playwright. As usual with Wodehouse, misunderstandings and coincidences abound. This is solid entertainment, recommended for public libraries.?Don Wismer, Cary Memorial Lib, Wayne, Me.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Paleo on a Budget: Saving Money, Eating Healthy</h2><p>Lose weight and feel better eating the same foods our ancestors did: meat, vegetables, fruit, eggs, nuts, and more!

It includes essays that place her work in the context of American and European 20th-century art and culture. Agnes Martin&#39;s paintings, constructions, and works on paper provide a link between the chromatic abstraction of artists such as Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman, her generational and ideological peers, and the Minimalist vocabulary of the 1960s. This book reproduces works made between 1957 and 1967, and better-known paintings and constructions created since 1974. A selection of Martin&#39;s writings reveals the spiritual philosophy that sustains her painting.</p><p>Painter Agnes Martin's quietly radiant geometric abstractions reflect her quest to capture moments of beauty or transcendence of ego and petty distractions. Her personal philosophy, as reflected in her semimystical writings, seems an amalgam of the Bible, Zen Buddhism, Taoism, William Blake and positive thinking. Featuring 60 color and 40 black-and-white plates, the volume profiles the Saskatchewan-born artist, now 80, who participated in the heyday of New York abstract expressionism and later settled in New Mexico. Whitney curator Haskell charts Martin's shifts from landscape to biomorphic abstractions to minimalism. Chave, a Hunter College art historian, looks at Martin's calm, grid-like compositions. Krauss, a professor at the City University of New York, endorses Martin's claim to be a classicist in the objective tradition of Egyptians, Greeks and Copts.

It was written by the developer of the Rocket Mass Heater, Ianto Evans, who is also co-creator of the Rocket Stove. Rocket Mass Heaters are in a family of efficient wood-burning stoves called Rocket Stoves. What these various types of Rocket Stoves all have in common is that they burn small-diameter wood fuel in a high-temperature combustion chamber with an insulated internal chimney. With clear, delightful illustrations and practical, accessible instructions, the Third Edition contains Case Studies (in full color) by ten stove builders who have been living with these stoves for several years, and have been teaching the craft. Even if you don&#39;t plan to build one of these stoves, you will learn practical skills about human comfort, self-reliance, and heating with wood. The casual reader comes away with an ability to build fires-from campfires to highly specific rocket stoves-and will understand how wood burns, and which wood burning stove is best for a given situation. The passionate stover comes away with all you need to build your own Rocket Mass Heater in your home, taking charge of your family&#39;s comfort. There is an updated Safety chapter by Art Ludwig and improved construction instruction based on builder feedback, and thanks to the viral popularity of this technology on the internet forums all over the world among passionate do-it-yourselfers, masonry stove builders, homesteaders, and Permaculture practitioners. In this book, you&#39;ll find a basic recipe for building a Rocket Mass Heater. Why basic? Because your stove will be made to your local climate specifications, in your unique house, and with materials you source according to luck/whim/opportunity/dumpster-diving law, or if nothing else, money.

It bloomed like a strange flower at the edge of the solar system, dwarfing Pluto in its size and majesty. It was beautiful; theory become real. The eyes of Earth turned upon it, and the space telescope Walton was redirected to examine it more closely. Within days, images were being sent back to Earth.<br> <br>What Walton revealed was a kind of blister in space, a lenslike swelling in the fabric of the universe. As one scientist remarked, to the discomfort of her peers, it looked almost as if humanity were being examined in turn. The stars behind it were distorted, and slightly off-kilter, an effect explained by the huge amount of negative energy necessary to keep the wormhole open. An intense light at its rim dimmed to a dark center like an unblinking pupil, and so the newspapers began to refer to it as &#x201c;the Eye in Space.&#x201d;<br> <br>Once the initial thrill of its discovery had worn off, disturbing questions were raised. Why had it not been seen before? Was it a natural phenomenon, or something more sinister?<br> <br>The early years of the twenty-first century had yet to offer any proof that mankind was not alone in the universe. Shortly after the discovery of the wormhole, mankind received conclusive evidence that the universe was more crowded than it had ever imagined.<br> <br>A fleet emerged from the Eye, a great armada of silver ships, graceful and elegant, moving unstoppably toward the small blue planet in the distance at speeds beyond human comprehension.<br> <br>And the people of Earth watched them come: steadily, silently. Efforts were made to contact the craft, but there was no reply. . . .<br> <br>Panic spread. There was talk of the end of the world, of imminent destruction. Riots crippled the great cities, and mass suicides occurred among the more extreme religious cults, convinced that their souls would be magicked up to the approaching starships.<br> <br>But wherever it was that their souls ended up, it was not on those ships.<br> <br>The fleet stopped somewhere near Mars, and Earth braced itself for attack. Some people fled to bunkers, others sought shelter in underground stations and subway systems, or retreated into caves. They waited for explosions and devastation, but none came. Instead, Earth&#x2019;s technological systems began to collapse: electricity, gas, water, communications, all were hit simultaneously, sabotaged by their own computers, but in a deliberate and targeted way. National defense systems shut down, but hospitals did not, and warplanes fell from the sky while commercial jets landed safely. All control had been seized by an outside force, but one that appeared careful to avoid more fatalities than were necessary. Still, fatalities there were.<br> <br>Now, Earth&#x2019;s generals warned, the real assault would come, but there was no further attack. The silver ships sat silently above, while below, society fell apart. There was looting and murder. Mass exoduses from the cities began. Cattle and livestock were stolen and slaughtered for food, so farmers began to shoot trespassers. Men turned against men, and so great was their fury that, at times, they forgot the fact of the aliens&#x2019; existence in the face of their own inhumanity. After a mere three days, armies were firing on their own citizens. All that mattered was survival.<br> <br>Then, on the fourth day, power was restored selectively to the hearts of nine capital cities across the world: Washington, London, Beijing, New Delhi, Abuja, Moscow, Brasilia, Canberra, and Berlin. A single word was sent to every computer in every government office. That word was: <br> <br>SURRENDER<br> <br>And Earth did indeed surrender, for what other choice did it have?<br> <br>���<br> <br>When the planet&#x2019;s new overlords eventually made themselves known, they were not what anyone on Earth had anticipated, for the Illyri were not unlike themselves. In their grace and beauty they resembled their ships. They were tall&#x2014;the smallest of them was no less than six feet&#x2014;with slightly elongated limbs, and their skin had the faintest of gold hues. Some had glossy, metallic manes of hair, whereas others kept their perfect skulls smooth and bald. They lacked eyelids, so their eyes were permanently open, and a clear membrane protected their retinas. When they slept, their colored irises simply closed over their pupils, leaving their resting eyes like vivid, eerie marbles set in their fine features.<br> <br>The Illyri spoke of a &#x201c;gentle conquest.&#x201d; They wished to avoid further bloodshed, and all necessities and creature comforts were restored to the people. However, modern weapons systems remained disabled. Air travel was initially forbidden. Telecommunication ceased, and for a time, the Internet no longer functioned. There was a period of adjustment that was difficult, but eventually something approaching normal life resumed.<br> <br>The Illyri knew what mattered most to the planet they had colonized, for their technology had been hidden on Earth for many decades, ever since the earliest human radio signals were detected by probes at the mouths of wormholes, and the first quiet infiltration of the planet began. Tiny clusters of Illyri androids, most no bigger than insects, had hidden in meteor showers and entered the atmosphere in the late 1950s. They began sending back details of Earth&#x2019;s climate, atmosphere, population. The Illyri followed the progress of wars and famines, and had seen the best&#x2014;and the worst&#x2014;of what the human race had to offer. The Internet had been a particular bonus. Nanobots embedded themselves in the system in the late twentieth century; not only were they capable of transmitting the sum total of mankind&#x2019;s accumulated knowledge back to the drones, they became part of the technology itself. As humanity embraced the Internet, and computers became an integral part of life, so too mankind unwittingly welcomed the Illyri into their lives and sowed the seeds for their arrival.<br> <br>After the initial shock of the invasion, the human resistance commenced. There were shootings and bombings. Illyri were kidnapped and killed, or held as hostages in a vain attempt to force a retreat from the planet. World leaders conspired to fight back.<br> <br>In response, the citizens of Rome were given twenty-four hours to evacuate their city. It was then wiped from the map in a massive explosion that sent dust and debris over all of western Europe, a reminder that Earth&#x2019;s empires were as nothing before the superior power of the invaders. The Illyri then announced that one-tenth of the population between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one in every city and town would be conscripted into the Illyri Military brigades for five years. Essentially the youths would be hostages. Each family from which a young adult was removed had a responsibility to report saboteurs, or face the consequences. If violence was committed against the invaders, the townsfolk were informed that they would never see their young people again. It was a charter for informers, designed to sow distrust and crush cooperation among those who would challenge Illyri rule.<br> <br>But the Illyri also offered hope. They erected great condensers in arid climates, transforming deserts to fields. They genetically modified fruits, and grains, and vegetables, making them more abundant and more resistant to disease. Within two years, hunger was virtually eliminated on Earth, as were many communicable diseases. Geoengineering&#x2014;the use of giant reflectors to send sunlight back into space before it struck the planet&#x2014;tackled the problem of global warming, reducing Earth&#x2019;s temperatures to levels not seen since the start of the nineteenth century.<br> <br>The Illyri did all that was possible to change Earth for the better.<br> <br>And still the humans fought us at every turn. . . .</p><h2>Eureka!: What Archimedes Really Meant and 80 Other Key Ideas Explained</h2><p>Translating elusive concepts from philosophy, psychology, science, politics, history, and economics, the author of Brush Up Your Shakespeare! offers down-to-earth explanations for more accessible reading.

After 42 years as the "Voice of the Detroit Tigers," the 2002 retirement of Harwell signaled the end of an era. This profile on the famed broadcaster provides the lesser-known details on the background of a Detroit institution. Known for his voice and talent for calling games, fans will be able to know the man himself and what brought him to&#x2014;and kept him in&#x2014;the Motor City. The only play-by-play broadcaster to cover games across seven decades, Harwell saw (and accumulated accompanying stories about) everyone from Babe Ruth to Ichiro Suzuki, many of which are shared in this entertaining biography.</p><p><b>Tom Keegan<i> </i></b>is the baseball columnist for the <i>New York Post</i>. He has worked previously in Baltimore, Chicago, and Los Angeles, and has been covering major league baseball since 1985. He&nbsp;lives in Norwalk, Connecticut. <b>Al Kaline </b>is a former Major League Baseball right fielder for the Detroit Tigers, and current front office official with the same team. He is a 18-time All-Star selection and a 10-time Gold Glove Award recipient. He was part of the team that won the 1968 World Series, a game which was broadcast by Ernie Harwell. He is a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. He lives in the Detroit area.Harwell has been the voice of the Detroit Tigers baseball team for more than 40 years. In 1991, the team's new owners--also owners of a nationwide pizza chain--decided to replace him. Pizza joints in Michigan started receiving bomb threats. Harwell was back behind the microphone the next season and is still going strong. This biography by <i>New York Post</i> columnist Keegan traces Harwell's life from childhood (growing up in Atlanta, he delivered Margaret Mitchell's newspaper) through his glory years with the Tigers. Testimonials from virtually every baseball star of the last half-century as well as anecdotes featuring such sports luminaries as golfer Bobby Jones and boxer Jack Dempsey spice the account nicely. There is plenty of Harwell's voice here, too, as well as that of his no-nonsense wife, Lulu. Harwell is a baseball institution and remains one of the game's most beloved ambassadors. Expect considerable interest in his story, especially among older fans, who will revel in the announcer's behind-the-scenes memories of the strong Tiger teams of the 1960s. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Bestselling novelist Andrew M. Greeley has captured the imagination of the mystery reading public with the improbable Bishop Blackie Ryan, who works for the aristocratic, haughty, sometimes arrogant but often slyly good humored Sean Cardinal Cronin, the Archbishop of Chicago. </p><p>The Vatican has just assigned auxiliary Bishop Gus Quill to the Archdiocese of Chicago over the violent protests of Archbishop Sean Cronin, and the not so silent protests of Bishop Blackie. Bishop Quill is under the illusion, one might say delusion, that he has been sent from Rome to replace the good Cardinal when in fact Rome was dying to get rid of him because of his incompetence. Immediately on arriving in Chicago, he manages to disappear while riding the L Train and it is up to Blackie to find him. As the Cardinal says, "The Vatican does not like to lose bishops, even auxiliaries." </p><p>And thus begins the search for the missing bishop who no one really wants to find. </p><p>Of course, none of this is too much for the intrepid little Bishop Ryan. He faces these problems squarely and, with the kind of deductive mind reminiscent of G.K Chesterton's Father Brown, manages to find solutions to some of the most baffling mysteries he has ever encountered.</p></p><p><i>The Bishop and the Missing L Train</i> is the ninth entry in Andrew Greeley's deservedly popular Father Blackie Ryan series. Auxiliary Bishop Augustus Quill, recently posted to the Chicago Archdiocese, could not be described as a loved man. His nickname, bestowed upon him by fellow seminarians, is "Idiot." Despite his relatively high position, one that implies significant intelligence, wit, piety, and compassion, the man seems lacking in all departments save piety. In fact, so disliked is Quill that someone is willing to stop at nothing--at least nothing short of absconding with an entire subway car, bishop included--to keep him from his appointed rounds.<p> Sean Cardinal Cronin, the Archbishop of Chicago, is no more a fan of Quill's than anyone. Still, the act of losing a bishop (or, more precisely, not retrieving an absconded-with bishop) would not be smiled upon by Rome. Fortunately for Cronin (and fans of humorous, clever, well-written amateur-sleuth mysteries everywhere), Bishop Blackie Ryan is on his side. </p><blockquote>"We cannot permit this, Blackwood!"<p> "Indeed."</p><p> "Auxiliary bishops do not slip into the fourth dimension, not in this archdiocese."</p><p> "Patently."</p><p> "Especially they do not disappear on L trains that also disappear, right?"</p><p> "Right!"</p><p> "You yourself have said that we will be the prime suspects, have you not? Don't we have powerful reasons for wanting to get rid of him?"</p><p> "Arguably," I sighed. "However, as you well know, in the best traditions of the Sacred College we would have dispatched Idiot with poison."</p></blockquote> As with any amateur sleuth worth the paper he's written on, Ryan has a cadre of variously talented (and oft-related) professionals--cops, psychologists, reporters, etc.--at his beck and call. And good thing, too, for there are that many and more likely suspects--about the same number, arguably, as there are reasons to devour the entire Ryan series. <i>The Bishop and the Missing L Train</i> is another ecclesiastical lulu. <i>--Michael Hudson</i><p>Priest, sociologist, author and journalist, <b>Father Andrew M.

He was also a frequent contributor to <i>The New York Times</i>, the <i>National Catholic Reporter</i>, <i>America </i>and <i>Commonweal</i>, and was interviewed regularly on national radio and television. He authored hundreds of articles on sociological topics, ranging from school desegregation to elder sex to politics and the environment.</p><p>Throughout his priesthood, Father Greeley unflinchingly urged his beloved Church to become more responsive to evolving concerns of Catholics everywhere. His clear writing style, consistent themes and celebrity stature made him a leading spokesperson for generations of Catholics.

Yet a complete understanding of the endgame&#x2014;from the 27 January 1973 signing of the Paris Peace Accords to South Vietnam&#x2019;s surrender on 30 April 1975&#x2014;has eluded us.<br><br><i>Black April</i> addresses that deficit. A culmination of exhaustive research in three distinct areas: primary source documents from American archives, North Vietnamese publications containing primary and secondary source material, and dozens of articles and numerous interviews with key South Vietnamese participants, this book represents one of the largest Vietnamese translation projects ever accomplished, including almost one hundred rarely or never seen before North Vietnamese unit histories, battle studies, and memoirs. Most important, to celebrate the 30th Anniversary of South Vietnam&#x2019;s conquest, the leaders in Hanoi released several compendiums of formerly highly classified cables and memorandum between the Politburo and its military commanders in the south. This treasure trove of primary source materials provides the most complete insight into North Vietnamese decision-making ever complied. While South Vietnamese deliberations remain less clear, enough material exists to provide a decent overview.<br><br>Ultimately, whatever errors occurred on the American and South Vietnamese side, the simple fact remains that the country was conquered by a North Vietnamese military invasion despite written pledges by Hanoi&#x2019;s leadership against such action. Hanoi&#x2019;s momentous choice to destroy the Paris Peace Accords and militarily end the war sent a generation of South Vietnamese into exile, and exacerbated a societal trauma in America over our long Vietnam involvement that reverberates to this day. How that transpired deserves deeper scrutiny.<br></p><p>George J. Veith, a former Army captain, has written extensively on the Vietnam War and POWs/MIAs.

It was only when she awoke that she realized she was in London, in the Chelsea house owned by the American, John Gould.</p><p>It was half past five in the morning when Charlotte let herself out of the house and into the street. Cheyne Walk was barely stirring, and the road held only a clattering echo of her own running feet. She was at the Embankment wall in just a few moments, leaning on the edge, staring at the lively grey ribbon of the Thames. <i>I shall be married</i>, she thought, <i>in a few hours. </i>She turned her face up to the rain.</p><p>It was April 1917; she was nineteen years old. And everywhere there was change. On the fields of Flanders, history was being written in the harrowing of humanity; in the pretty eighteenth century house behind her, her own mother lived in what some called sin, but what Charlotte could see was a kind of correctness, a way of holding on to life. In Yorkshire, her once happy father habitually mourned in bitterness. The world rolled and altered.</p><p>She held on to the Embankment wall, feeling its granite strength. Someone had told her that the stones of the wall here had come from Cornwall, from Lamorna Cove. It was supposed to be wildly lovely there, but she had never seen it. She had, despite her nursing service at St. Dunstan&#x2019;s, never seen France. Her brother, Harry, was back there now, advising the Flying Corps. She had never seen America, as Mr. Gould had done; she had never been to Italy. She had wanted to take the Grand Tour as her male ancestors had once done. But she doubted that she would now. She was to be a married woman.</p><p>She turned away from the river, trying to hold down the nonsensical impulse to throw herself into the water. She had nothing at all to be worried about, she told herself. This was just a morbid anxiety, a last-minute rush of pre-wedding nerves. She must grow up, and stop wanting some romantic notion of independence. After all, what did she have to be worried about? Michael Preston was a wonderful man, a brave man. His blindness was no barrier; they were, as he always joked, a good team. Her parents were pleased that she was about to marry into one of Kent&#x2019;s oldest and most respected&#x2014;not to say very wealthy&#x2014;families; that she would be secure and cared for. That she would live a stone&#x2019;s throw from her family&#x2019;s London house in Grosvenor Square, in a lovely little mews cottage that Michael&#x2019;s parents had bestowed upon them. Her father had even hinted obliquely at the grandchildren that she and Michael would provide, and she so longed to see him happy again. She was desperate not to bring further disappointment into his life.</p><p>Yet the old sense of suffocation threatened to overwhelm her.</p><p>She looked back through the trees at the houses on Cheyne Walk. John Gould now owned one of the prettiest, his gift to her mother, Octavia. They lived like two honeymooners here, and for the last six months Charlotte had come here often, absorbing both their scandal and their happiness in equal measure. She was to be married from here, and not the Grosvenor Square house where her father was now staying in solitary and temporary splendor among the dusty relics of his marriage. Now and then, in talking to him, it had become obvious that he expected his wife to eventually return to him. People called him an old fool for it, she knew. It was her older sister, Louisa, who tended to look after Father; Charlotte was drawn to her mother. But sometimes the longing for the old untouched days at Rutherford would return in her; the innocence of it all, the feeling that England would never change. The ancient conviction that the Cavendish estate of Rutherford and that charmed and luxurious way of life was eternal.</p><p>Charlotte smiled to herself. Well, they had all had that permeability knocked out of them now.</p><p>She wondered, as she looked at Cheyne Walk, at the other dramas that had played out in this London street over the centuries. In Number 16, Dante Gabriel Rossetti had lived out his final years with Fanny Cornforth; Number 4 was George Eliot&#x2019;s last home. Just along the way was the Chelsea Hospital and the Physic Garden. And it had been here, last October, that Charlotte had sat with her mother and told her that Michael had proposed to her. In the seventeenth-century green oasis by the Thames, Charlotte had expected Octavia to tell her that she was far too young. In retrospect, she had hoped that this was indeed what her mother was going to say. She would have returned to Michael and told him that, without her mother&#x2019;s approval, she could not possibly marry him, flattered as she was to have been asked. But, to her astonishment, Octavia had not objected at all. In her own half-dazed and happy state, she had simply clasped Charlotte&#x2019;s hands and smiled at her, and given her blessing. But it was not her mother&#x2019;s blessing that Charlotte had wanted. She had wanted her mother&#x2019;s disapproval, and an excuse not to marry at all.</p><p>It was very strange, she considered, that in all these months, it had only been John Gould, her mother&#x2019;s lover, who had carefully and subtly questioned her decision. &#x201c;Shall you be very happy as a little wife?&#x201d; he had said to her in a joking fashion last Christmas. She had looked at him gravely, the champagne glass in her hand as the dinner guests settled around the dining table on the day before Christmas Eve. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think that I could be?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d replied. John, in his handsome and easy way, had considered her. &#x201c;You always struck me as a wild bird waiting to fly,&#x201d; he had commented. &#x201c;Well, one can fly when one is married,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d told him. And then had blushed scarlet. &#x201c;I mean, as a couple. We could fly anywhere, anywhere at all.&#x201d;</p><p>If he had noticed her embarrassment, he hadn&#x2019;t dwelled upon it. &#x201c;Come to America when this lousy war is over,&#x201d; he had said. &#x201c;And see the house I&#x2019;ve built for your mother on Cape Cod. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll like it. America, too.&#x201d;</p><p>Her heart had welled up inside her. Oh, she was sure that she would love the beach, the house, the country. The very words spelled out freedom and space. And of course she could go there with Michael&#x2014;of course they would love to, she told John. She had then deliberately turned away from him and his piercing appraising gaze. She had spoken gaily to the woman on the other side of her; but about what, she had no idea at all.</p><p>Since then, she seemed to have been swept forward by events. Michael&#x2019;s parents were charming; their grand home in its beautiful gardens outside Sevenoaks was charming; Michael himself was, of course, charming. But how &#x201c;charming&#x201d; grated on her to the roots of her soul! How maddening she found it. How ridiculously she had painted herself into this lover&#x2019;s corner. Into maturity and security and all those other things that her father so approved of. She thought she should die of it.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop it,&#x201d; she said out loud, to no one at all but herself. &#x201c;What a silly, selfish fool you are.&#x201d;</p><p>She walked back to the house and let herself in the gate. In six hours, at midday, her father would come here in the Rolls-Royce he had lately acquired. They would be chauffeured to the parish Church of St. Margaret&#x2019;s at Westminster Abbey, within sight of the abbey itself and the famous clock tower of the Palace of Westminster that was familiarly called Big Ben.</p><p>There would be crowds at the church door because society weddings were food and drink to a war-weary London, and because it was seen to be a great romance, this union of the blinded war hero and the youngest child of a loyal servant of the Crown. Police on horseback would hold back the throng; there would be cheers as she emerged from the car dressed in what she&#x2014;oh so privately, oh so secretly&#x2014;thought was a completely idiotic costume of a white silk dress and a vast tulle veil. Her sister, Louisa, would be there at the church door, laughing prettily and scattering rose petals. And, after the ceremony, the thunder of the <i>Meistersinger</i> march on the church organ would compete with the pealing of bells of St. Margaret&#x2019;s. And she and Michael would stand together at the porch, smiling, arm in arm.</p><p>And all the time, she would be wanting to run.</p><p>The door of the house opened as she approached it, and there was the housemaid, looking frightened that someone was already outside as she reached to polish the door frame and the brass handle of the bell. &#x201c;Oh, miss,&#x201d; she said, beaming when she saw that it was Charlotte. &#x201c;The happiest day of your life. We are all that excited, miss, if you&#x2019;ll pardon me saying.&#x201d;</p><p>Charlotte stepped over the threshold and shook off the coat that had become saturated with rain.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re quite right, Milly. It&#x2019;s the happiest day of my life.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>The Ritz hotel commanded one of London&#x2019;s greatest thoroughfares, and was within sight of Green Park and Buckingham Palace. It was the new creation of C�sar Ritz himself, and looked much like a French chateau that had been gracefully dropped in Piccadilly, complete with its modern refinements and Louis XVI furnishings.</p><p>The arrival of the Cavendish and Preston wedding party caused as much of a stir on Piccadilly as it had at the church in Westminster. A crowd gathered to watch the bride and groom emerge from the wedding car; but they were equally interested in the great and good of the nation that followed. Politicians whom they recognized only vaguely, whose top-hatted appearance was greeted with polite applause, were followed by officers in uniform, ladies of the aristocracy, and a small scattering of artists from the Slade. Murmurs of scandal and appreciation rose and fell like waves until the last guest disappeared behind the gilt-and glass doors.</p><p>Charlotte&#x2019;s father, William Cavendish, the seventh Earl Rutherford, was well pleased with the overall effect of the wedding, despite the Oranges and Mauves. Privately, this was what he called the artists that his estranged wife, Octavia, seemed to so admire. Still, the gallant officers were rather more impressive, and he was glad that Charlotte, despite having inherited some of her mother&#x2019;s more stubborn and outrageous characteristics, now appeared to be settling into a respectable life. William liked Michael Preston, and admired him for his stoicism in the face of his terrible injuries. One would hardly credit that the man was blind; his face bore no sign other than a few discolored lines around the forehead. He carried himself with dignity, and he was intelligent and modest. Such qualities might carry him far, William thought. He had even wondered if he might introduce Michael to those whom he knew in government when the war was over.</p><p>William stood now at the entrance to the large dining room and looked about himself. He and his daughter Louisa had arranged the wedding on Charlotte&#x2019;s behalf. Or, rather, Louisa had done the majority of the arranging and he had done all of the paying. It showed in the room. The table displays were opulent, the flowers in full bloom despite it only being April. Each table bore its white damask cloths, its silver and glass and decorations of silk and ribbon, like stage sets. He saw that, in among the color on the high table, Charlotte looked rather lost. <i>Dear girl</i>, he thought. Something had overwhelmed her robust personality at last. She seemed to be very small there among the sea of society faces, and rather pale. He caught a waiter as the man walked past. &#x201c;Take a glass of champagne to the bride,&#x201d; he murmured. &#x201c;And make sure she is served first.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled with pride. Louisa sat to Charlotte&#x2019;s left, looking terribly pretty. Far to the right sat Octavia, Charlotte&#x2019;s mother. He saw that she and Louisa briefly exchanged a glance of satisfaction, and he supposed that Louisa&#x2019;s immaculate organization of the day perhaps had much more to do with his wife than he had supposed. Well, what did it matter? Octavia was largely shunned by society, but she had probably found a way to help her daughter. Women were subversive creatures, he thought. One never really knew. Never really knew at all.</p><p>He walked up to the top table. It took him some time; matrons of the beau monde would tend to leap up as he passed, and press him engagingly to their breasts as if he were an abandoned child. Over the last year, he had grown used to brushing them off with politeness. He was not abandoned, in his opinion. He was merely put aside for a while. Octavia&#x2014;he was determined about it, determined to the point of being almost convinced&#x2014;that Octavia would return to him once the American had grown tired of her. She would leave the little house in Chelsea and return to Rutherford where she belonged. He gritted his teeth and turned his face away in the meantime. She would come home. It was surely inevitable. Men like John Gould wouldn&#x2019;t look after another man&#x2019;s wife indefinitely. As for his own heart&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he didn&#x2019;t like to consider it at all. He had been brought up not to linger on the subject of feelings. He would present an equable face to the world, no matter how many nights he laid awake and wondered what the hell had happened to his marriage.</p><p>As he passed the final table before he sat down, he noticed a familiar face. It was Caitlin de Souza, his son Harry&#x2019;s friend. She sat unmoving, her hands clasped in her lap, dressed in a somber outfit of pale brown with a lace collar.</p><p>&#x201c;Caitlin, is it?&#x201d; he said, and held out his hand.</p><p>&#x201c;It is, your lordship.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On leave?&#x201d; Caitlin was a nurse at the front.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Grim as ever, I take it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is terribly grim, yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Heard from Harry?&#x201d;</p><p>It was typical of William to talk in such abbreviated sentences. He saw no need to pontificate. He loathed small talk. Caitlin smiled, and at once he remembered why Harry, who was presently serving with the Royal Flying Corps, was so attracted to her. &#x201c;He writes very often,&#x201d; she murmured.</p><p>William lowered his face close to hers. &#x201c;Persuade the old fellow to do the same for his parents, why don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;Take it as a personal favor.&#x201d;</p><p>He stood back up, squeezed her hand, and walked on. To the other side of the table, directly opposite Caitlin, he had noticed the disheveled form of Christine Nesbitt. At least, she looked disheveled to him. Why did these artists never run a comb through their damned hair, he thought. And she seemed to be dressed in something like a curtain. Good Lord, it was a wonder that the Ritz had allowed her across the threshold!</p><p>It was probably Octavia who had shepherded the woman inside. Octavia had taken a liking to the Bohemian type since she had moved to Chelsea. She had even hosted an art fair in Rutherford, to raise money for the Red Cross among the wealthy of the Yorkshire set. It had been a success, of course. Everything that Octavia turned her hand to was a success. She and Charlotte had run the whole thing last November, and made a great deal of money for the cause. Still, the presence of the artists themselves had shocked him. Peacocks and sluts, he had decided. Peacocks and sluts.</p><p>Christine Nesbi...</p></p><h2>Ali-A Adventures: Game On!

His father gives Tomasito a new pet to make him smile, but this bird is a little bit different. Can Tomasito's featherless friend teach him that there's more than one way to fly? Will the cheers Tomasito hears on the sidelines ever be for him? <br><br>Award-winning author and poet Juan Felipe Herrera scores yet again with this sparkling story of friendship and self-empowerment. The brilliant acrylic paintings by Ernesto Cuevas, Jr., burst off the page with sheer joy.</p><p>Grade 1-3&#x2013;Tomasito is having a hard time adjusting to his new school. Even though he wants to do what the other kids do, spina bifida keeps him wheelchair bound. To help him with his transition, his supportive and loving father gives him a new pet. Desplumadois a featherless bird that cannot fly. But, as Tomasito learns with the help of a new friend, there is more than one way to fly, and more than one way to play soccer. He is great at heading the ball, and as his participation and inclusion in the Fresno Flyers soccer team becomes a reality. Herrera's prose poem is a paean to those children who overcome adversity to create inclusion. Cuevas's oil illustrations, with forms surrounded by heavy black lines, work well in the soccer scenes but seem lumpy and inert in the indoor scenes, where the hues are darker and muddier. Still, this title could be used for a storytime focus on acceptance and tolerance and in ELL programs. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.K-Gr. 3. In this bilingual picture book, the text is better than the somewhat garish acrylic illustrations. Unable to walk because of his spina bifida, Tomasito feels unconnected in his new school. His father brings him a featherless parrot for company, but the boy wants nothing to do with a bird that looks so different. Eventually, Tomasito finds a place for himself on the soccer field, where he learns that one doesn't necessarily need feathers to fly. The message is heavy, but always the poet, Herrera transforms the language to depict both the boy's isolation and later his boundless joy. The Spanish offers slightly richer detail than the English: a "<i>casita-trailer</i>" is more descriptive, for example, than the simple <i>trailer.</i> An encouraging story, especially for Latino children with disabilities, who may recognize themselves and find their own ways to fly. <i>Julie Kline</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

When a man who is straight as a stick moves in, the residents are mistrustful because he looks all wrong. After a scribbled woman befriends him, she is harshly judged, and an angry mob gathers to protest the immigration of other straight individuals. Fortunately, a thoughtful child unites the townspeople by drawing a picture&#x2013;Some of it scribbled,/and some of it straight. From this point on, relations between scribbles and straights are much improved, and soon some new folks move in&#x2013;Some scribbled&#x2013;some not. The whimsical stick-figure illustrations, done in pencil, Magic Marker, and chalk on vellum, are the real attraction in this book. Holwitz maintains an elegant balance between order and chaos, achieving a highly stylized version of a child's scribble. The text, unfortunately, is not as well executed. The bouncy, rhymed couplets belie the seriousness of the theme, and the resolution is too pat. While youngsters sometimes do lead the way to the reconciliation of differences, the journey is seldom as smooth as the road to Scribbleville.<i>&#x2013;Rachael Vilmar, Atlanta Fulton Public Library, GA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She lives in Louisville, Kentucky.Bestseller Robards (<i>Superstition</i>) opens her latest romantic thriller with a bang by placing her heroine, assistant district attorney Sarah Mason of Beaufort County, S.C., in the midst of a convenience store robbery gone wrong. A cashier is shot to death, Mason is wounded in the head and a young girl, who was hiding in the store during the gunplay, vanishes. Mason, who has thrown herself into her work with a vengeance since the disappearance of her five-year-old daughter, Lexie, 10 years earlier, becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. The action rarely lets up, except for the many sexually charged scenes devoted to Mason's initially platonic relationship with PI Jake Hogan, "the closest thing to family" she has left, who worked as a detective on Lexie's case and who routinely comes to her rescue during this new case. The plot, with its suggestions that the holdup was not a random act and eerie phone calls apparently from a Lexie who hasn't aged, will keep readers turning the pages. <i>Author tour.

She still had something she needed to say, and she refused to give in to the lure of death until she was done giving her instructions to her sister, Grace.<br><br>Grace sat by the hospital bed, her eyes swollen with unshed tears and her heart breaking as she watched Mary struggle to speak. The gentle beeps and soft hums were gone; the countless medical machines monitoring her decline had been removed just an hour ago. A pregnant stillness had settled over the room in their stead. Grace sat in painful silence, willing her sister to live.<br><br>The phone call telling Grace of the automobile accident had come at noon yesterday. By the time she had arrived at the hospital, Mary's child had already been born, taken from his mother by emergency surgery. And by six this morning, the doctors had finally conceded that her sister was dying.<br><br>Younger by three years, Mary had always been the more practical of the two sisters, the down-to-earth one. She'd also been the bossier of the two girls. By the time she was five, Mary had been ruling the Sutter household by imposing her will on their aging parents, her older half brothers still living at home, and Grace. And when their parents had died nine years ago in a boating accident, it had been eighteen-year-old Mary who had handled the tragedy. Their six half brothers had come home from all four corners of the world, only to be told their only chore was that of pallbearers to their father and stepmother.<br><br>After the beautiful but painful ceremony, the six brothers had returned to their families and jobs, Grace had gone back to Boston to finish her doctorate in mathematical physics, and Mary had stayed in Pine Creek, Maine, claiming the aged Sutter homestead as her own.<br><br>Which was why, when Mary had shown up on her doorstep in Norfolk, Virginia, four months ago, Grace had been truly surprised. It would take something mighty powerful to roust her sister out of the woods she loved so much. But Mary only had to take off her jacket for Grace to understand.<br><br>Her sister was pregnant. Mary was just beginning to show when she had arrived, and it was immediately obvious to Grace that her sister didn't know what to do about the situation.<br><br>They'd had several discussions over the last four months, some of them heated. But Mary, being the stubborn woman she was, refused to talk about the problem with Grace. She was there to gather her thoughts and her courage and decide what to do. Yes, she loved the baby's father more than life itself, but no, she wasn't sure she could marry him.<br><br>Was he married to someone else? Grace had wanted to know.<br><br>No.<br><br>Did he live in the city, then? She'd have to move?<br><br>No.<br><br>Was he a convicted felon?<br><br>Of course not.<br><br>For the life of her, Grace could not get her sister to tell her why she couldn't go home and set a wedding date -- hopefully before the birth date.<br><br>Mary wouldn't even tell her the man's name. She was closed-mouthed about everything except for the fact that he was a Scot and that he had arrived in Pine Creek just last year. They had met at a grange supper and had fallen madly in love over the next three months. She'd gotten pregnant the first time they made love.<br><br>It was another four months of bliss, and then Mary's world had suddenly careened out of control. In the quiet evening hours during a walk one day, the Scot had told her a fantastical tale (Mary's words), and then he had asked her to marry him. <br><br>Two days later Mary had arrived at Grace's home in Virginia.<br><br>And for the last four months, Grace had asked Mary to reveal what the Scot had told her, but her sister had remained silent and brooding. Until she had announced yesterday, out of the blue and with a promise to explain everything later, that she was returning to Pine Creek. Only she hadn't been gone an hour when the phone call came. Mary had not even made it out of the city when her car had been pushed into the opposite lane of a six-lane highway by a drunk driver. It had taken the rescue team three hours to free Mary from what was left of her rental car.<br><br>And now she was dying.<br><br>And her new baby son was just down the hall, surprisingly healthy for having been pulled from the sanctuary of his mother's womb a whole month early.<br><br>A nurse entered the room and checked the IV hooked up to Mary, then left just as silently, leaving Grace with only a sympathetic smile and a whisper that Grace should let her know if she needed anything. Grace rushed to follow her out the door.<br><br>"Can she see the baby?" Grace asked the nurse. "Can she hold him?"<br><br>The nurse contemplated the request for only a second. Her motherly face suddenly brightened. "I think I can arrange it," she said, nodding her approval. "Yes, I think we should get that baby in his mother's arms as soon as possible." <br><br>She laid a gentle hand on Grace's shoulder. "I'm sorry, Miss Sutter, for what's happening here. But the accident did a lot of damage to your sister, and the emergency cesarean complicated things. Your sister's spleen was severely ruptured, and now her organs are shutting down one at a time. She just isn't responding to anything we try. It's a wonder she's even conscious." <br><br>The nurse leaned in and said in a whisper, as if they were in church, "They're calling him the miracle baby, you know. Not one scratch on his beautiful little body. And he's not even needing an incubator, although they have him in one as a precaution."<br><br>Grace smiled back, but it was forced. "Please bring Mary her son," she said. "It's important she sees that he's okay. She's been asking about him."<br><br>With that said, Grace returned to the room to find Mary awake. Her sister's sunken blue gaze followed her as she rounded the bed and sat down beside her again.<br><br>"I want a promise," Mary said in a labored whisper.<br><br>Grace carefully picked up Mary's IV-entangled hand and held it. "Anything," she told her, giving her fingers a gentle squeeze. "Just name it."<br><br>Mary smiled weakly. "Now I know I'm dying," she said, trying to squeeze back. "You were eight the last time you promised me anything without knowing the facts first."<br><br>Grace made a production of rolling her eyes at her sister, not letting her see how much that one simple word, dying, wounded her heart. She didn't want her sister to die. She wanted to go back just two days, to when they were arguing the way sisters did when they loved each other. "And I'll probably regret this promise just as much," Grace told her with false cheerfulness.<br><br>Mary's eyes darkened. "Yes, you probably will."<br><br>"Tell me," she told her sister.<br><br>rd"I want you to promise to take my baby home to his father."<br><br>Grace was stunned. She was expecting Mary to ask her to raise her son, not give him away.<br><br>"Take him to his father?" Grace repeated, slowly shaking her head. "The same man you ran away from four months ago?"<br><br>Mary weakly tightened her grip on Grace's hand. "I was running back to him yesterday," she reminded her.<br><br>"I'm not making any promises until you tell me why you left Pine Creek in the first place. And what made you decide to return," Grace told her. "Tell me what scared you badly enough to leave."<br><br>Mary stared blankly at nothing, and for a moment Grace was afraid she had lost consciousness. Mary's breathing came in short, shallow breaths that were slowly growing more labored. Her eyelids were heavy, her pupils glazed and distant. Grace feared her question had fallen on deaf ears. But then Mary quietly began to speak.<br><br>"He scared me," she said. "When he told me his story, he scared the daylights out of me."<br><br>"What story?" Grace asked, reaching for Mary's hand again. "What did he tell you?"<br><br>Mary's eyes suddenly brightened with a spark of mischief. "Lift my bed," she instructed. "I want to see the look on your face, my scientist sister, when you hear what he told me." <br><br>Grace pushed the bed's lift button and watched her sister sit up. Mary never called her a scientist unless she had some outrageous idea she wanted to convince her was possible. Grace was the rocket scientist, Mary was the dreamer.<br><br>"Okay. Out with it," she demanded, seizing on that one little spark like a lifeline. She settled a pillow behind Mary's head. "What did lover boy tell you that made you run away?"<br><br>"His name is Michael."<br><br>"Finally. The man has a name. Michael what?"<br><br>Mary didn't answer. She was already focused on gathering her words as she stared off into space over Grace's right shoulder. <br><br>"He moved to Pine Creek from Nova Scotia," Mary said. "And before that he lived in Scotland." She turned her gaze to Grace, her drug-dilated, blue eyes suddenly looking apprehensive. "He told me he was born in Scotland." And then, in a near whisper, she added, "In the year 1171."<br><br>Grace straightened in her chair and stared at Mary. "What?" she whispered back, convinced she had heard wrong. "When?"<br><br>"In 1171." <br><br>"You're meaning in November of 1971, right?"<br><br>Mary slowly shook her head. "No. The year eleven hundred seventy-one. Eight hundred years ago."<br><br>Grace thought about that. Fantastical was putting it mildly. But then she suddenly laughed softly. "Mary. You ran away from the man because he believes in reincarnation?" She waved her hand in the air. "Heck, half the population of the world believes they've led past lives. There are whole religions based on reincarnation."<br><br>"No," Mary insisted, shaking her head. "That's not what Michael meant. He says he spent the first twenty-five years of his life in twelfth-century Scotland and the last four years here in modern-day North America. That a storm carried him through time."<br><br>Grace was at a loss for words.<br><br>"Actually," Mary continued, "five of his clan and their warhorses came with him."<br><br>Grace sucked in her breath at the sorrow in her sister's eyes. "And where are these men now? And their...their...horses?"<br><br>"They're dead," Mary said. "All of them. Michael's the last of his clan." Her features suddenly relaxed. "Except for his son now."<br><br>She reached for Grace's hand and gripped it with surprising strength. "That's why I was going back. Family is important to Michael. He's all alone in this world, except for our baby. And that's why you have to take his son to him."<br><br>Mary let out a tired breath. "I'm dying." She looked at Grace with sadly resigned eyes. "You have to do this for me, Gracie. And you have to tell Michael I love him." Tears were spilling over her cheeks. <br><br>Grace stared down at her sister through tears of her own.<br><br>"Will you listen to yourself, Mare? You're asking me to take your son to a madman. If he really believes he's traveled through time, then he's touched in the head. You want him bringing up your child?"<br><br>Mary released a shuddering breath and closed her eyes again. A stillness settled over the room once more.<br><br>Mary was asking her to take a child -- her nephew -- to a man who was not sane. Grace covered her face with her hands. How could Mary ask such a thing of her?<br><br>And how could she not grant her sister's dying wish?<br><br>The door opened again with a muted whoosh, and Grace looked up to see a clear plastic basinet being wheeled into the room. White cotton-covered little arms waved in the air, the sleeves so long there was no sign of the tiny hands that should be sticking out of the ends.<br><br>Grace had to wipe the tears from her eyes to see that Mary was awake again, straining to see her baby. <br><br>"Oh, God. Look at him, Gracie," Mary whispered, reaching toward him with a shaking hand. "He's so tiny."<br><br>The nurse placed the basinet next to the bed. She put a pillow on Mary's lap and carefully placed Mary's cast-covered right arm on top of it. Then she picked up the tiny, squeaking bundle from the basinet and gently settled him on the pillow in Mary's lap.<br><br>"He's so pink," Mary said, gently cupping his head. "And so beautiful."<br><br>"He's thinking it's dinnertime," the nurse said. "You might as well feed him a bit of sugar water if you feel up to it."<br><br>"Oh, yes," Mary said, already tugging at his blanket.<br><br>The nurse repositioned him in the crook of Mary's broken arm and handed her a tiny bottle of clear liquid with a nipple on it. The tubes sticking in Mary's left hand tangled in her child's kicking feet. The nurse moved around the bed, handed the bottle to Grace, and carefully removed the IV from Mary's hand, covering it with a bandage she pulled from her smock.<br><br>"There. You don't really need this," she said, hanging the tubes on the IV stand. She took the bottle of sugar water back and stuck it in the fretting baby's mouth. Free now, Mary awkwardly but eagerly took over.<br><br>The nurse watched for a minute, making sure Mary could handle the chore, then turned to Grace.<br><br>"I'm going to leave you in privacy," the nurse said, her eyes betraying her sadness as she smiled at Mary and her son. She looked back at Grace. "Just ring for me if you need anything. I'll come immediately."<br><br>Panic immobilized Grace. The nurse was leaving them alone? Neither one of them knew a thing about babies.<br><br>"Look, Gracie. Isn't he beautiful?" Mary asked.<br><br>pardGrace stood up and examined her nephew. Beautiful? He was unquestionably the homeliest baby she had ever seen. His puffy cheeks were red with exertion, his eyes were scrunched closed, his chin and neck blended into a series of overlapping wrinkles, and gobs of dark straight hair shot out from under a bright blue knit cap.<br><br>"He's gorgeous," she told Mary.<br><br>"Pull off his cap," her sister asked. "I want to see his hair."<br><br>Grace gently eased off her nephew's cap but was immediately tempted to slip it back on. Two rather large, perfectly formed ears popped out a good inch from his head, pushing his now freed hair into frenzied spikes.<br><br>He looked like a troll.<br><br>"Isn't he beautiful?" Mary repeated.<br><br>"He's gorgeous," Grace reconfirmed, trying with all her might to see her nephew the way her sister did. <br><br>Mary was the animal lover in the Sutter household and was forever dragging home scruffy kittens, wounded birds and chipmunks, and mangy dogs. It was no wonder Mary thought her little son was precious.<br><br>He was. Homely, but precious.<br><br>"Let's undress him," Mary said. "Help me count his fingers and toes."<br><br>Startled, Grace looked at her sister. "Count them? Why? Do you think he's missing some?"<br><br>Mary gave a weak laugh as she wiped her son's mouth with the edge of his blanket. "Of course not. That's just what new mothers do."<br><br>Grace decided to humor her sister. Gingerly, she attempted to undo the strings at the bottom of the tiny nightshirt. It was a difficult task as the baby, now happy with a full belly, kept kicking his legs as he mouthed giant bubbles from his pursed lips.<br><br>Finally, with her two good hands and Mary's unsteady uninjured one, they freed his legs. Grace held up first one foot and then the other and counted his toes out loud.<br><br>She counted them again.<br><br>Twelve.<br><br>Six on each tiny foot.<br><br>Mary gave a weak shriek of joy. At least, it sounded joyful. Grace stared at her numbly.<br><br>"Gifts from his daddy," Mary said in a winded whisper. "Michael has six toes on each foot."<br><br>And this was a joyful thing? Grace wanted to ask. Being deformed was good?<br><br>"Pull his shirt and diaper off," Mary said then. "I want to see him naked."<br><br>Grace was afraid to. What other surprises was the clothing hiding? But she did as her sister asked, even though she feared the tiny baby wo...</p><h2>War Is a Racket: The Antiwar Classic by America&#39;s Most Decorated Soldier</h2><p><i>War Is a Racket</i> is the title of two works, a speech and a booklet, by retired US Marine Corps Major General and two-time Medal of Honor recipient Smedley Darlington Butler.

The only way in or out is a lift that comes, empty, twice a day. With no food and no contact with his captor, Linus begins a journal. On the third day, a 9-year-old girl named Jenny appears, and food is finally delivered. Over several days, four more captives arrive, all adults, including a big, burly junkie, an uptight young businesswoman and a middle-aged businessman. Last to arrive is Russell, a famous philosopher who's dying of a brain tumor. In a setting reminiscent of Jean-Paul Sartre's <em>No Exit</em>, this suspenseful, riveting winner of the 2014 Carnegie Medal explores existentialism through the different stages of life embodied by the six characters. Jenny wonders what they're being punished for and why their captor is so bad. Linus wonders why they are there and what their captor wants. He notices that the clocks are being manipulated and ponders what past, present and future mean when you're captive and dependent on an all-powerful "Man Upstairs" for life's essentials. Wise Russell, the only character of color, calmly works out where they must be and helps the others see the humanity in themselves and each other. <strong>Brooks' latest is not an easy novel, but it's one that begs for rereading to suss the intricacies of its construction of plot, character development and insight into the human condition.</strong> Not for everyone, this heady novel is worthy of study alongside existentialist works of the 20th century." &#x2015;starred, <em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"When this latest book from controversy-stirrer Brooks won the 2014 Carnegie Medal in the UK, up piped a familiar chorus of damnation from the frequently scandalized. It was too bleak, too dark, not for kids. The naysayers almost got it right: <strong>it is, </strong>rather,<strong> for everyone, playing just as well as can't-stop-reading entertainment as it does an allegorical passage into darkness.</strong> Linus, 16, is duped to assist an apparent blind man, then chloroformed, then abducted. He awakes in a small underground bunker: a kitchen, bathroom, meeting room, and six bedrooms. Why six? As with much in this book, the answer is a stark inevitability. One by one, five more abductees arrive via an elevator: a little girl, an old man, a rich woman, a businessman, and a junkie. But hopes of building a coalition across social lines is quashed after initial attempts to escape fail. The elevator door is electrified. The vents in the ceiling emit pepper spray. Deafening sirens make disabling the cameras impossible. From there, the 'games' only become more insidious, from subtle manipulations of the group's sense of time to outright drugging of the food. And, finally, a note, which suggests to the inmates a deal too horrible to comprehend. It may sound like a horror film, but it comes across as existential dread. Linus, writing the book in his journal, begins to refer to the abductor as 'He,' with a capital H. It's chillingly appropriate, for He has become a godlike figure issuing 'covenants' on slips of paper and, by His own inscrutability, demanding blind worship and pleas for forgiveness from His flock. Despite His capricious cruelty, the humans fear being abandoned by Him. Given Brook's past work, it's no stretch to think that this piercing interpretation of religion is intentional. But that's just for starters. The blank canvas of the bunker acts as a screen upon which one can project almost anything. Is 'Bird,' the businessman, so named because he is the canary in the coal mine, his breakdown signaling the coming toxicity? Is the self-cannibalizing group a metaphor for old Russell's brain cancer, or vice versa? Or is this, quite simply, Hell, a place of stillness where one can only ruminate over a life of regrets and shudder at the g-dung, g-dunk noise of the elevator bringing down the next torture? What will fascinate (or, yes, disturb) readers is Brooks' refusal to provide any off-ramps from his one-way street. That doesn't make Brooks 'Him'&#x2015;he's not toying with us for perverse kicks. He is, in fact, doing the opposite, telegraphing the end long before it arrives, thereby granting us the opportunity, at a safe distance, to put lives upon the microscope and gauge their density. By extension, we look at our own lives, and consider our worth when removed from familiar settings, trapping, vices. What if there was a seventh room, and it had your name on it?" &#x2015;starred, <em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Linus is a 16-year-old runaway living on the harsh English streets who wakes up one day in an unfamiliar underground bunker with no water or food while under constant surveillance by an unknown kidnapper.

When Linus and the rest try to escape and find out more about their situation and their kidnapper, they realize that, with their options dwindling, they may have to resort to the ultimate horror to survive.

Each inmate has a tale of being snatched and drugged, awakening in an elevator that opens into the bunker. Every room is surveilled by camera and microphone; the bedrooms are equipped with a Bible, pen, and notebook. Requests sent to their captor via elevator are sometimes answered, sometimes ignored, and sometimes terribly perverted. There's little by way of character development; Linus at the end is the same boy he was at the beginning, with a lot more experience of suffering. The Man Upstairs, literally and figuratively (Linus begins to think of him as He), is never revealed. <strong>Relentlessly bleak, this recent Carnegie Medal&#x2013;winner fascinates, provokes, and horrifies as Brooks (<em>iBoy</em>) stays true to his nihilistic aims, pushing readers toward an inexorable conclusion.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"A runaway from his posh boarding school, Linus has been on the streets in London for months when he's abducted and rendered unconscious, waking up to find himself in a self-contained, thick-walled bunker, dense with hidden cameras and microphones, whose only access is through an elevator (with controls accessible only on the other end). Five more people (one for each small room in the bunker) arrive in turn: perceptive nine-year-old Jenny; glamorous and shallow twentysomething Anja; tough ex-junkie Fred; slimy management consultant Bird; and elderly philosopher Russell. As days go by, food, rewards, and sometimes punishments and mind games are delivered to the six via the lift and they become increasingly desperate to escape this madman-created captivity; meanwhile, Linus writes his experience in one of the few items allotted to them, his notebook. The plot is strongly reminiscent of Sleator's classic <em>House of Stairs</em> (<em>BCCB</em> 11/74), but British author Brooks (<em>Candy</em>, <em>BCCB</em> 2/05, etc.), who won the Carnegie Medal for this title, brings his own disturbing take to the premise; where Sleator was cool and clinical, <strong>Brooks is messy, angry, and nihilistic</strong>. Characterization of the inhabitants isn't always deep, but they're there to be types, and the focus on their various responses to the situation is gripping. The mystery behind their tormentor's identity simmers in the background, but the group's desperate attempts to find a way out and their increasing dissolution are more significant, savage, and shocking, placing the reader along with their mad captor in watching these people's road to destruction. <strong>There's no easy out or absolution, but that's going to interest readers</strong> with horror-story tolerance; if you're looking for discussion, introduce this along with Foucault's concept of the panopticon, or merely prompt students to consider if there's a religious allegory here."&#x2015;<em>The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>Norway (Major World Nations)</h2><p>Surveys the history, geography, economy, government, people, and culture of Norway.</p><p>Grade 7 Up?Despite new covers and a different series title, these volumes are virtually unchanged from their earlier editions as "Places and Peoples of the World" (1990).

Some readers have remarked that the book is more a comic book than a real novel, and it's true that reading this incendiary call to protect the American wilderness requires more than a little of the old willing suspension of disbelief. The story centers on Vietnam veteran George Washington Hayduke III, who returns to the desert to find his beloved canyons and rivers threatened by industrial development. On a rafting trip down the Colorado River, Hayduke joins forces with feminist saboteur Bonnie Abbzug, wilderness guide Seldom Seen Smith, and billboard torcher Doc Sarvis, M.D., and together they wander off to wage war on the big yellow machines, on dam builders and road builders and strip miners. As they do, his characters voice Abbey's concerns about wilderness preservation ("Hell of a place to lose a cow," Smith thinks to himself while roaming through the canyonlands of southern Utah. "Hell of a place to lose your heart. Hell of a place... to lose. Period"). Moving from one improbable situation to the next, packing more adventure into the space of a few weeks than most real people do in a lifetime, the motley gang puts fear into the hearts of their enemies, laughing all the while. It's comic, yes, and required reading for anyone who has come to love the desert. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Forever War</h2><p>From the front lines of the battle against Islamic fundamentalism, a searing, unforgettable book that captures the human essence of the greatest conflict of our time. <br> <br>Through the eyes of Dexter Filkins, the prizewinning <i>New York Times</i> correspondent whose work was hailed by David Halberstam as &#x201c;reporting of the highest quality imaginable,&#x201d; we witness the remarkable chain of events that began with the rise of the Taliban in the 1990s, continued with the attacks of 9/11, and moved on to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. <br> <br>Filkins&#x2019;s narrative moves across a vast and various landscape of amazing characters and astonishing scenes: deserts, mountains, and streets of carnage; a public amputation performed by Taliban; children frolicking in minefields; skies streaked white by the contrails of B-52s; a night&#x2019;s sleep in the rubble of Ground Zero. <br> <br>We embark on a foot patrol through the shadowy streets of Ramadi, venture into a torture chamber run by Saddam Hussein.

Narrated by the author, the production is less a dramatized experience (as is the case with Robertson Dean&#39;s unabridged recording) and more a personal monologue on modern warfare. Filkins delivers a reading that is stripped down and unabashed, but the simplicity of his narrative approach doesn&#39;t undermine the gravity of the events he relates. His voice carries an indefinable weight that one can only acquire from having experienced war firsthand and having lived to tell about it.

Rhys, born in 1890 in Dominica, the West Indies, had a Welsh father and a mother who was a Dominican Creole. The Creole influence would pervade her life and writing. At the age of 17, Rhys left Dominica to go to England, where she tried several careers--actor, chorus girl, artist's model--before she started to write. Her familiarity with the seedy side of London life is evident in her novels, many of which have the repeated theme of the helpless female, victimized by her dependence on a man for support and protection. Rhys had numerous love affairs throughout her long life; even at age 80, she enjoyed flirting with critic Alfred Alvarez, whose article about her in The New York Times Book Review on March 17, 1974, ``The Best Living English Novelist,'' made Rhys, briefly, a best seller. After several early novels such as After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie (1931) and Voyage in the Dark (1935), she stopped writing. Then she published Wide Sargasso Sea (1967), her story of the first marriage of Mr. Rochester of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. Many of Rhys's novels have autobiographical origins, and Angier, an English writer and teacher, seems determined to connect every inhalation in Rhys's life with an exhalation in one of her novels. Thus, the reader stumbles through explanatory parentheses (as many as six a page), interspersed with speculative phrases (``I think''; ``Did she know? I doubt very much''; ``Would she have? Surely not''). Perhaps Angier's exhaustive but unsorted research will be of value to some future biographer who will do justice to Rhys, a fine writer. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In 1973 critic Al Alvarez called her the best living English novelist, and in the same year PW reported a "rush" on her novels, among them Quartet, Voyage in the Dark and her masterpiece, Wide Sargasso Sea. Rhys (1890-1979) was an odd bundle of qualities that included narcissism, paranoia, charm, self-pity, self-destructiveness, rage against men and a general wildness of temperament that owed something to the steamy island of Dominica where she was born. But as British freelance writer Angier amply shows in this hefty critical biography--where fact and insight lie cheek by jowl--she was adept at "distilling truth out of evasion and art out of pain." For her (and her heroines), loving meant losing, a lesson acquired through several marriages and passionate affairs, the most formative, from the literary point of view, with Ford Madox Ford. Perhaps this impressive study will trigger another rush on a poetic novelist now suffering a mild neglect.

Dreaded and reviled by many, these nineteenth-century buildings provide a unique window on how the Victorians housed and treated the mentally ill.</p><p>Despite initially good intentions, they became warehouses for society's outcasts at a time when cures were far fewer than hoped for. Isolated, hidden in the countryside and surrounded by high walls, they were eventually distributed throughout Britain, the Empire, the Continent and North America, with 120 or so in England and Wales alone.</p><p>Now the memory of them is fading, and many of the buildings have gone or are threatened. Most have been closed as hospitals since the 1980s and either been demolished or turned into prestigious private apartments, their original use largely forgotten. </p><p>Their memory deserves rehabilitation as a fascinating part of Victorian life that survived into modern times. In The Victorian Asylum, Sarah Rutherford gives an insight into their history, their often imposing architecture, and their later decline, and brings to life these haunting buildings, some of which still survive today.</p></p><p>Sarah Rutherford is a Kew-trained horticulturist who obtained an MA in the conservation of historic parks and gardens at York University. She later worked for English Heritage assessing sites across England for the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens, becoming Head of the Register. During this time she researched and completed her doctoral thesis on the landscapes of nineteenth-century lunatic asylums and visited many before they were closed and redeveloped. She is now an enthusiastic freelance consultant researching and writing conservation plans for parks and gardens.</p><h2>True Justice</h2><p>For Butch Karp, chief assistant district attorney for New York County, the nightmare begins when a shocking act of negligence results in homicide. Goaded by the media's sensational publicity, the public is screaming for blood, and Karp's boss, D.A. Jack Keegan, is listening. He has ordered the prosecution of a fifteen-year-old for murder, intent on making a very public example of the girl. A Hispanic from a poor neighborhood, she's an easy mark for big-city bureaucracy and bigotry. It is Butch Karp's unpleasant job to see that the prosecution gives the public what it wants: a quick and thorough administration of hard-line justice.<br>Complicating matters further is Butch's wife, Marlene Ciampi, a private investigator who has decided to return to practicing law. Her first case takes her a few hundred miles south to a small Delaware town, where an equally unspeakable tragedy has taken place. Marlene, however, has the unenviable task of taking on a politically ambitious local prosecutor who is pressing to charge a suburban teenager with capital murder.<br>With Butch and Marlene squaring off on opposite sides of an increasingly incendiary national debate, things couldn't get any more tense...until a shocking turn of events puts their daughter, Lucy, at the center of a horrifying crime.</p><p>District Attorney Butch Karp and his pistol-packing wife Marlene Ciampi, the liveliest crime-fighting couple in New York, are back in <i>True Justice</i>. The first set of infanticides happen on Butch's watch: a wave of gruesome incidents in which newborns are killed or abandoned by their indigent teenage mothers. The second, Marlene's case, is straight out of the headlines: a middle-class college girl and her boyfriend are indicted for first-degree murder in the death of their baby after a concealed pregnancy.<p> The most interesting story belongs to Lucy, Butch and Marlene's teenage daughter, an incisively brilliant and complex young woman who deserves her own novel. Lucy's best friend's parents seem to have been murdered by an African furniture restorer of whose guilt Lucy is unconvinced. The real solution to the mystery of who killed the Maxwells is telegraphed well in advance, but all the crimes give Butch, Marlene, their colleagues in criminal justice, and even Lucy a chance to weigh in on the law's fault lines and the ironies implicit in what passes for justice in America. But it's Lucy's spiritual quest that provokes the book's most unusual and involving drama. Lucy's devout Catholic faith, like her prodigious talent for language (she can speak 14, but give her five days in a foreign country and that'll be 15, thank you), is a mystery to Butch, a lapsed Jew, and Marlene, who has trouble squaring her own faith with the violence that attends her job. When a Jesuit priest tries to explain it in the following passage, Butch is nonplused: </p><p> </p><blockquote>"Lucy takes her spiritual responsibilities very seriously. And of course, in the current age, when people think there's no such thing as spiritual responsibility, she has nothing to compare herself to, and so she may get herself painted into a corner." <p> "I'm not sure I follow," said Karp. </p><p> "Oh, I mean, two or three hundred years ago, a girl with her talents and predilections would have been in an order, with hourly guidance and a rule to follow. Think of Mickey Mantle being born in, say, Romania in 1830. The talent's there, but there's no cultural space for it."</p></blockquote> <p> This is a keenly intelligent book, many cuts above the usual courtroom procedural. The most interesting things happen outside the courtroom--the moral dilemmas, the political choices, the bonds between parents and daughter. The pacing is as swift as the dialogue, the characters are piercingly illuminated, and the philosophical jousting is worth a room full of Jesuits. This reader is heading straight for Tanenbaum's backlist and eagerly anticipating another novel with Lucy as the star. --<i>Jane Adams</i></p><b>Robert K Tanenbaum</b> is one of the country�s most respected and successful trial lawyers.

Her education took her to the London School of Economics, and during the war, she worked in the War Office. She published her first novel, <b>Jumping the Queue</b> at the age of seventy. It was followed by nine more. Mary Wesley died in 2002.Late-bloomer Wesley published this first novel in Britain at the age of 70a fact that explains the breadth of experience reflected here. As a practical decision, Matilda Poliport, middle-aged and recently widowed, is preparing at the story's outset to commit suicide before the trials of old age can beset her. But she is temporarily thwarted by an encounter with a highly publicized gentleman murderer on the runa matricide, in fact. Matilda whimsically decides to shelter the otherwise sympathetic killer for a few days and agrees to abet his escape to the Continent. Within their brief, strangers-on-a-train-like intimacy, Matilda talks frankly about her life, while the matricide remains strangely silent about his odious crime. However, what the reader learns about Matilda is far more than she admits to herself. Wesley leaves us wondering about the limits of human knowing and what anyone can ever finally determine about either the past or one's true motivations. Reality in this contemporary novel remains an open system. The rub is that Matilda, on the one hand, is remarkably self-aware but, on the other, not only self-deluding but also the victim of a reductive imagination, outright lies and withheld or fragmentary informationpitfalls, the novel suggests, that await the reader of this or any other narrative, be it fiction or so-called fact. The novel is delivered in a bright, sparkling style, full of witty asides on the fatuity of modern culture and mores, all the better to underscore its dark themes. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>New York Dolls: Photographs</h2><p>&#x201c;The Dolls told me: <i>We know you as you really are, and you&#x2019;re OK by us.&#x201d;</i>--Morrissey, from his Afterword&nbsp;Formed in New York City in 1971, the New York Dolls prefigured Punk, New Wave, and Glam Metal Rock with their over-the-top style and their ingenious sound, setting the tone for many rock bands that would later come on the scene.

Consequently, businesses around Japan display &#x201c;Japanese Only&#x201d; signs, denying entry to all 'foreigners' on sight. Employers and landlords routinely refuse jobs and apartments to foreign applicants. Japanese police racially profile 'foreign-looking' bystanders for invasive questioning on the street. Legislators, administrators, and pundits portray foreigners as a national security threat and call for their segregation and expulsion. Nevertheless, Japan&#x2019;s government and media claim there is no discrimination by race in Japan, therefore no laws are necessary.<br><br>How does Japan resolve the cognitive dissonance of racial discrimination being unconstitutional yet not illegal? Embedded Racism carefully untangles Japanese society&#x2019;s complex narrative on race by analyzing two mutually-supportive levels of national identity maintenance. Starting with case studies of hundreds of individual &#x201c;Japanese Only&#x201d; businesses, it carefully analyzes the construction of Japanese identity through legal structures, statute enforcement, public policy, and media messages. It reveals how the concept of a &#x201c;Japanese&#x201d; has been racialized to the point where one must look &#x201c;Japanese&#x201d; to be treated as one.<br><br>The product of a quarter-century of research and fieldwork by a scholar living in Japan as a naturalized Japanese citizen, Embedded Racism offers an unprecedented perspective on Japan&#x2019;s deeply-entrenched, poorly-understood, and strenuously-unacknowledged discrimination as it affects people by physical appearance.</p><p>Debito Arudou is author of the critically-acclaimed <i>Embedded Racism: Japan's Visible Minorities and Racial Discrimination</i> (Lexington Books, 2015), co-author of the bilingual&nbsp;Handbook for Newcomers, Migrants, and Immigrants to Japan&nbsp;(2nd Ed. 2012), and author of both the English and Japanese versions of "'<i>Japanese Only': &nbsp;The Otaru Hot Springs Case and Racial Discrimination in Japan</i>" (3rd Ed. 2013). &nbsp;He is also&nbsp;creator of the twenty-year-old award-winning online archive on life and human rights in Japan, debito.org.This book, though, is more than a narrative of instances of discrimination and campaigns for redress. The author also seeks to explore the roots of the problem, which he locates in the legal apparatus of nationality, the workings of the court system, the lack of serious official mechanisms to combat discrimination, and stereotypes perpetuated by the mass media.... This book is an important addition to the literature on problems of citizenship and minorities in Japan, particularly because it highlights the distinctive problems of visible minorities, rather than focusing on the large &#x2018;invisible minorities&#x2019; (Zainichi Koreans and Chinese, etc.) who have been the subject of much existing research.... This is an important, courageous and challenging book, and it casts a sharp light on problems which are often ignored or veiled, but which have profound consequences for the present and future of Japanese society. (Tessa Morris-Suzuki, Australian National University,&nbsp;<em>Japanese Studies</em>)<br><br>Debito Arudou demonstrates that racism is pervasive in Japan and that many individuals and institutions deny this reality. He also shows that racism augurs ill for a society that will shrink for decades to come unless it changes how it treats visible minorities. People who care about the future of Japan need to engage with this pellucid and provocative account of one of the country&#x2019;s most urgent but neglected problems. (David T. Johnson, University of Hawaii)<br><br>In this important and insightful book, and based on a long personal experience, Debito Arudou offers a sophisticated critical analysis of the way visible minorities are treated in contemporary Japan. As immigration of work seekers to wealthy countries is on the rise, the issues treated here have wider relevance not only to the conduct and future of the Japanese society, but also to many other societies in the West and beyond. Highly recommended! (Rotem Kowner, University of Haifa)<br><br>Hats off to Arudou for breaking once and for all the Silence Barrier that has permitted Japan&#x2019;s profound racial discrimination to purr along undisturbed well into the 21st century. Exposing at long last the definitional acrobatics of Japanese and foreign Japan Studies experts&#x2014;who have argued that since there is nothing we could call racist attitudes in Japan it follows that there can be no systemic racial discrimination either&#x2014;Arudou lays out voluminous evidence to the contrary showing how Japan actually operates in its laws, public policy, media messages, and social ordering.

Hall, author of Bamboozled: How America Loses the Intellectual Game with Japan and its Implications for Our Future in Asia)<br><br>Japan Times readers familiar with columnist Debito Arudou&#x2019;s views on the politics, policies and perils of an exclusionist national identity can now access a fuller scholarly elaboration in 'Embedded Racism: Japan&#x2019;s Visible Minorities and Racial Discrimination.'

The noise, which was of a strange drunken revelry, would usually begin long after the pubs had closed, though in the deeps of the night I never knew exactly what time it was. I was merely summoned by the sound of unearthly groans and shrieks outside my window that seemed to belong neither to the world nor to my dreams but somewhere in between. They might have been men&#x2019;s voices or women&#x2019;s, it was hard to tell. The noise they made came from a region that outlay human identity. Their long, inchoate monologues, vocalized yet senseless, seemed to name something that afterward could not be specified, to describe what by daylight appeared indescribable. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>This demoniacal groaning would often go on for so long that it seemed impossible it could be coming from living people passing on the pavements. It was the sound of lost souls, of primitive creatures bellowing far inside the earth. Yet I never got up to look: the noise was so unreal that it was only when it stopped that I felt myself to be actually awake. Then I would lie there, full of a feeling of insecurity, as though the world were a wildly spinning fairground ride from which my bed might work loose and be somehow flung away. The groaning sounds and the darkness and the carelessly spinning earth, offering me its fathomless glimpses of space, of nothingness: all this would run on for one hour or two or three, I couldn&#x2019;t tell.The hours were blank and sealed, filled with gray information: one after another they were dispatched. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Then another sound would begin, dimly at first, a kind of humming or droning, steady and industrious. After a while it filled the room with its monotonous note. This was the sound of traffic. People were going in their cars to work. A little later a finger of wan light showed itself at the curtains. When I was a child the night seemed as big as an ocean to me, deep and static: you rowed across it for hour after hour and sometimes got so lost in time and darkness that it seemed as if the morning might never be found. Now it was a mere vacuum, filling up with human activity as a dump is filled with discarded objects. It was an empty space into which the overcrowded world was extending its outskirts, its sprawl. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>We were living in Bristol at that time, and the slaving past of the city was always present to me, though in the middle-class district of Clifton its brutality was largely semantic, recalling itself amid the boutiques and sofa shops of Whiteladies Road and Blackboys Hill. Yet it seemed to have seeped into the masonry, into the paving stones. I was often told that thebeautiful Georgian terraces of Clifton had for years been neglected and threatened with demolition and that students and artists had lived there contentedly in conditions approximating squalor. But that was in the past: these days the slave owners&#x2019; houses were smart again and unaffordable, the streets lined with beauty salons and expensive cars, the baize lawns of the private schools trodden by millionaires&#x2019; children from China, America, Japan. Clifton estate agents carried themselves with the preening significance of royal courtiers, while the fume-throttled city sprawled below, with its bombed-out center, its ghettos, its miles of strange, impoverished housing, its uneasy atmosphere both of misrule and of a thorough-minded, inexorable division. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Something of the hard-heartedness of that imperial past seemed to live on in the people I met and spoke to every day. Man, woman, and child, they found sensitivity intolerable. Nothing irked them more than the liberal conscience, unless it was anoutspoken sense of injustice. These things impinged on their free bigotry, and on the sense of humor that depended on it. They were not cold or unfriendly; quite the reverse. It was just that their philosophy formed an edifice of startling indelicacy amid the fluted columns and porticoes, the classical perspectives and cloudlike silhouettes, the ancient parks and pavilions, the secret rotundas and rich, ornamented interiors that were their habitat. It was a philosophy composed of two primitive blocks: that everyone should work for what he had; and that what mattered were the good things in life. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Encompassing so little in and of itself, this was a philosophy that required, for the sake of texture, of content, a God&#x2014;and indeed the churches of Clifton did a thriving trade, on the import and the export side alike. I encountered notionsof Christian charity that might have come from the pages of a Victorian novel, so ignorant did they seem of the concept of social democracy, and was beleaguered everywhere by advertisements for the evangelical Alpha course, which, for an initiative that targets those who have lost their way in life, seemed in Clifton to be remarkably well attended. These advertisements took a somewhat startling form: one day I passed one and was driven to stop and look at it twice. It was a photograph ofa man in climbing equipment standing in sunlight on the pinnacle of a mountain. I was surprised, almost affronted, by the caption, which read: Is there more to life than this? I wasn&#x2019;t entirely sure there was, nor ought to be. But I pondered it all the same. It had a profound effect on me, though not quite the one it intended. Whenever I thought of it, I feltmyself drawing to the threshold of a revelation, a realization so large that it was difficult to see its full extent. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Down in the city, the turgid river creeps between its sludge-gray banks. The Avon Gorge rises steeply to either side. A busy road runs down it: the roar of traffic echoes all along the chasm, rising and revolving like a vortex. Once there were mammoths here, and bears, and strange swimming dinosaurs with pointed beaks and close-set eyes. There is a placard by the gorge with drawings of these creatures, and a timeline. It is as straight as a ruler: it runs through the Paleolithic and the Neolithic and the Jurassic, through ice ages colored blue. At the end there is the stub of humanity, smaller than an arrowhead on its long shaft of time. Where it is going nobody knows. The line stops: the future is blank. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Every day at the same time I leave the house and walk my children to school. They are five and six. They each wear a navy-blue uniform, and carry a nylon schoolbag of the same color. These things identify them, just as in their picture books the Romans are identified by their togas, the Victorians by their bustles and top hats. They are modern schoolchildren: they belong to their moment in history, which gathers them up in its great impersonal wave. Now and then they make a toga out of asheet, or dress up in the crumpled raiment of an Indian squaw that lies with other costumes in a chest in their room. In the dim light of an English winter in an English provincial city, the forms of other eras vaguely suggest themselves, like mountains in mist. But none of it obstructs the passage of the arrow that flies on and on into its endlessly repeating blankness. They go to school and come back again, go and come back, go and come back. They are happy enough to do it, though theyretain a certain neutrality, as though they have been promised an explanation and are patiently waiting for it to be given. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>It is on their behalf that I nurture my deepest stores of repulsion for the God advertisement and its insolent question. Ifthere are to be lies, let them not concern the value of life, for not everyone has tired of it yet. Let them not denigrate the world, for there are those whose chance to see it has not yet come. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>On New Year&#x2019;s Eve we go to a party on Dartmoor. In the morning I wake in an unfamiliar bedroom and look through the window at the moor veiled with rain. The shrouded hills are desolate. They seem to extend on and on, into an indistinct kind of infinity. After breakfast the women sit on sofas, talking. Their children dart in and out. Sometimes they reach out and catchone, to hold its squirming body and stroke its bright, fine hair. Their female forms are fixed and sculptural: though the children squirm, they are glad to be held by something so firm. The women are both shelter and shrine&#x2014;they offer and at the same time they ask. They have agreed to stay still: it is the children who choose, between security and risk. It is important that they choose correctly. They mustn&#x2019;t cling to their mothers; nor must they forget to swim past, close enough to be caught. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>I stare through the window. From here it looks as though you could walk into the vista of gray hills and never stop, walk and walk without ever reaching anything you could call by its name. In time we decided to leave Clifton and move elsewhere. Our friends were sorry to see us go. They did not believe that we would find a place we liked better, for it seemed obviousto them that we were afflicted with restlessness and with a love of the unknown that in their eyes was a kind of curse, like the curses in mythology that are forever sending people from their homes to seek what perhaps can never be found, for it is in the seeking itself that the punishment lies. Yet I had a terror of my own, which was the fear of knowing somethinginits entirety. To seek held no particular fear for me: it was to find, and to know, and to come to the end of knowing thatIshrank from. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Go we must: go we would. But where?

Some people would call 16-year-old Liz Kitchell and her family truly fortunate, but it doens&#39;t feel that way to her. It seems that only a miracle can give 8-year-old Katie her holiday wish. She wants a family, something she does not have as a foster child. As for 17-year-old Matt, he too is in a foster home and is finally letting himself feel a sense of belonging. When he allows himself to do a good deed for Katie, he doesn&#39;t realize what would happen.

He is known among his fellow wrestlers as a man who knows how to hold on to the money he earns and how to make it work for him. He lives in Texas.<b>Chapter One: Play The Hand Dealt You</b><br><br><b>Life Goes On</b><br><br>The great poet Robert Frost said he could sum up everything he's learned about life in three words: It goes on.<br><br>Only when you realize that the past cannot be changed and only the future remains will you be able to plan that future. It is very easy to know where you want to be, but if you don't know where you are, then you will have an extremely hard time planning a route to get there.<br><br>There are counseling offices around the world full of people that want to blame the system for their circumstances. The sun was in their eyes, their shoes were untied, or -- ever popular -- their environment was not conducive to success. For goodness' sake, if Abilene Christian University had not discriminated against me with such silly rules as attending class and making good grades, I would have graduated with honors.<br><br>Dr. Carl Jung said, "When you realize that the whole world has problems, then you are on your way to mental health."<br><br>Once you realize that you are not the only person in the world who has a mortgage and other problems, then you can figure out a way to a better future. Everyone has problems to deal with; the key to success is how you deal with those problems.<br><br>If all your time is spent thinking about how badly life has mistreated you, all your time is spent in the past and you are ignoring your future. You are gravely mistreating yourself, and there won't be any improvement in your situation. However, you can't spend your time patting yourself on the back either, which is also doing your future no good. You simply have to play the hand dealt to you.<br><br>Where you are in life, good or bad, there is nothing you can do about it. You can only control where you will be in the future.<br><br><b>Sigmund Freud's Couch</b><br><br>I have never been to Dr. Jung's office, but I have been to the office in Vienna, Austria, of his main rival -- Dr. Sigmund Freud. In 1994 I was working in Vienna for Otto Wanz and Peter William for the Catch Wrestling Association. On a day off, my wife, Cindy, and I decided to go sightseeing. Actually, we spent most of our time sightseeing; I once told Otto that this wrestling every night was really getting in the way of us seeing the world.<br><br>We decided this day to go to see Dr. Freud's preserved office. As we entered the office, I realized that we were standing in front of Dr. Freud's famous couch. It was roped off, and there was a guard there. I couldn't resist the temptation of sitting on the couch, so I waited for the guard to leave the room, then I moved past the barricade and sat on the famous couch. Nothing happened. I did sit on the couch, but the envy that Dr. Freud was so famous for talking about never materialized. If it did, I sure wouldn't admit it here.<br><br>You can spend all your time griping about the past, talking about opportunities missed, or you can spend it planning a better future. A lot of people around the world do exactly this. They gripe about where they are in life and the circumstances that got them there. They spend so much time griping about the past that their future is affected negatively by the fact they won't spend any time planning to make it better. The cards you are dealt have to be played in the best possible way. Griping about the dealer won't help you any.<br><br>My options when I was released from the World League were simple. I could gripe about bad knees and unfortunate timing, or I could go on with my life and figure out what I was going to do next. I had wasted what I made financially, though I had an extremely good time doing it. And I do mean a good time. Actually, I had a great time.<br><br>It's always fun to blow money. The problem was, I didn't find a medium where I was enjoying life and also preparing for a future. I had priced perfection into my future, something virtually everyone does. However, pricing perfection into your future can be extremely dangerous. You will see this phrase quite often in this book.<br><br>Remember, I don't believe in making yourself miserable now because you are planning for your retirement. You have to enjoy life now; there is no guarantee you will be on this earth until retirement.<br><br>Life is about living, not just existing.<br><br>However, money and opportunities are too hard to come by to waste foolishly, and I decided not to let that happen again.<br><br><b>Life on the Bread Line</b><br><br>The day I was released from the World League, I didn't have many options. I kept going on up I-35 back toward Athens, realizing that there was nothing I could change about what had happened with my career and my finances. The past was gone; there was nothing I could do to change the fact that I was broke. I had to have a plan. I had realized this at last. I guess some things have to be learned the hard way for some people -- but learn I did. I knew that whatever I did, if I were fortunate enough to make decent money again, I would not blow a second chance.<br><br>I came to the realization that five years from that point, I needed to be better off than I was then, or I would have just wasted five more years. Although having $28 in my bank account would have been a little bit better, I also realized I needed to quantify how much better off I wanted to be.<br><br>It was hard admitting to myself that where I was financially was not where I should be, but I knew that was the truth. I had to come to the realization that I had not been good with my finances. It is extremely hard to admit failure. Remember, I said this was easy, not painless.<br><br>Convincing yourself of that reality is the first, and usually the hardest, step in figuring out your next move. A lot of people know where they want to be. But unless you know where you are currently, you can't plan the most direct route to get there.<br><br>I had spent three years playing professional football, and fulfilled one of my childhood dreams. I thought I would play a lot longer, but that didn't come to pass. I had always thought I would enjoy being a wrestler. I am not one of these guys who got into wrestling because I had no other options. Being a wrestler was appealing to me. I wanted to be part of this great entertainment genre.<br><br>I was a big fan at a time when Texas wrestling was in its heyday. I used to love to watch wrestling every Saturday night at ten o'clock with my grandfather, Cato Sheerer, who I thought the world of. I remember pulling for Fritz Von Erich and rooting against Skandor Akbar. Little did I know how fond I would grow of Akbar as my manager when I started out as a bad guy in Texas, and how much he would help me in the wrestling business.<br><br>I even set up a wrestling ring made of garden hose wrapped around trees, and the neighborhood kids and I would wrestle. I was the reigning champion of Hailey Street.<br><br>I actually have a past of violence in my family. I am descendant of the MacGregors from Scotland, of which Rob Roy was the most famous. In fact, Rob Roy was the one that got our name banned for many years. I still plan on returning to Scotland and reclaiming my homeland one day.<br><br>Back during its heyday, wrestling was done in territories. The Von Erichs in Dallas and the Funks in Amarillo ruled Texas. These were the two wrestling shows I got to watch when I was growing up in Sweetwater. There was a World Wrestling Federation then, but it was a northeastern territory, and we didn't get any of their television programming.<br><br>Some guys could be one character in one territory and a completely different one in another territory. There were no national television deals like there are now. A wrestler may have been a good guy in Minneapolis, but when he came to Texas, he could be a bad guy and few, if any, fans knew. Television deals were syndicated locally or, at best, statewide.<br><br>Even though I was basically starting over, I looked at my situation as a chance for a second career. I had always thought football was going to be my career path. Now I was getting a chance at another dream, <i>and</i> a second chance at my financial future.<br><br>There are all kinds of stories about people breaking into the wrestling business. There is no one tried-and-true way. There's no college draft, no true farm system. You have to promote yourself and learn the hard way how to get to the top. Some make it through a certain contact. Some are second- and third-generation wrestlers. Others spend years on the independent circuit, hoping someone from WWE picks up on them or hears enough about them to give them a look. There is only a certain amount of WWE television time each week. People who make it to WWE aren't exactly happy about giving up their roster spot; they worked too long to get there. Of course, out of the many that try, most never do make it to WWE.<br><br>When I got started, options were there, but I had already defined my goal. I knew where I wanted to be. The hard part was planning the road map of how to get there. That was the first part of my route. I wanted to go to the best wrestling school around.<br><br>Right or wrong, I felt playing at a Division II college hurt me in the NFL and World League drafts. Some great players have come from smaller schools -- the best receiver to ever play, Jerry Rice, went to Mississippi Valley State; Walter Payton, one of the NFL's all-time leading rushers, went to Jackson State; and Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair played at Alcorn State. There are plenty of small-school NFL success stories. But for the most part, players at that level have a mark against them.<br><br><b>Brad Rheingans</b><br><br>I got in touch with Brad Rheingans, one of the best 220-pound Greco-Roman wrestlers in our country's history. Brad finished fourth in the 1976 Montreal Olympics. He was the favorite to win gold in the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow, but the United States boycotted the games. It's amazing how something like the Olympics that is supposed to be apolitical could be used as political leverage. All the boycott did in 1980 was hurt the dreams and goals of a bunch of our young men and women who wanted so badly to represent this great country. Brad was now running a wrestling school in Minneapolis and had (and still does have) a tremendous reputation.<br><br>So I loaded up the blue truck, and this time I headed up I-35 to Minnesota. Amazing how much time I spent on that road during this part of my career. I was playing the hand that was dealt to me in the best way I knew how to play it.<br><br>I realized that the past was gone, and the only thing I had left was my future. I decided that what I wanted was to wrestle, and I knew by looking at the number of people who'd tried and not made it that wrestling was a long shot.<br><br>I had to plan my route and do everything I could to play the hand dealt to me wisely. I knew the best chance I had was to be trained by the best, and that was why I was now in Minnesota, training with Brad.<br><br>I quickly learned that wrestling was not fake. Fixed? Yes (most of the time). Fake? No. I have been in matches where there was no set outcome, and I have been in matches and seen other matches where one outcome was called and there was a double-cross. They are few and far between, but there is always that possibility, and that does help add to the mystique of wrestling.<br><br>"Fake" is definitely the wrong word to use. Just because you know something is coming doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.<br><br>People always ask how you learn to fall. Actually, gravity is the best teacher.<br><br>Brad was a great teacher and an even better person. I knew from the minute I got into the ring he built in his garage that this was what I wanted to do with my life. That doesn't mean it wasn't tough.<br><br>I don't think I was expecting it to be quite that tough. It was the equivalent of a very long, hard two-a-day training camp.<br><br>I loved the hard work. We would do conditioning after practice and wrestle Greco-Roman style. Brad really enjoyed doing conditioning with me. I noticed he always arranged to wrestle me; I think he enjoyed showing a former professional football player why he was a world champion.<br><br>Hard work gives you a lot of pride in what you are doing. The hand I was dealt was not that great of a hand, but I was playing it as wisely as I could. I knew that this was a necessary part of going through the process of bettering myself so that I would have a chance to screw up again with my money. However, this time I knew I wouldn't blow my opportunity.<br><br>One thing you'll realize when you do finally reach your goal is that getting there can be as enjoyable as being at the top. I enjoyed the training and the discipline of Brad's wrestling school; I enjoyed the prospect of making it in the wrestling business. I truly believe that if you aren't happy now, then you won't be happy later.<br><br>Happiness is a state of mind, not a position in life.<br><br><b>Big Money in Independent Wrestling</b><br><br>It's not always going to be a lot of fun. There were times when I drove to Dallas and got $3 for driving four hours round trip by some promoter/wrestler who was taking advantage of young guys because he knew they had no option; if they didn't take the money, one of the local wrestlers would. These guys never considered the fans. I shouldn't mention any names because that would sound like sour grapes, but then again, those grapes are already sour.<br><br>I would have to say guys like Iceman King Parsons who could no longer make it to the big time were among the worst. And these guys have the audacity to wonder why you never help them when you make it. Iceman actually gave me the advice to turn down WWE and stay in local wrestling in Texas. That was sage advice; I don't know why I didn't listen. He had just generously paid me $3 for a night's work and three hours of driving.<br><br>I wondered if it was ever going to get better. I wondered if I hadn't taken a wrong turn on the road that was supposedly going to take me to WWE.<br><br>But this was my current situation. I was learning the business. I was learning how to wrestle. I had the choice of griping about it or making the best of it. I had to play the hand dealt to me.<br><br>To better yourself financially, you have to deal with your financial reality.

You're still going to have to draw the future road map yourself, but this shows you where you start from.<br><br><i>It doesn't matter where you are -- it is where you are headed that's important.</i><br><br>This is where you are. That number at the bottom of the worksheet may or may not look pretty, but it's reality. I once had a coach say that it didn't matter where you are, all that is important is where you are headed. That doesn't mean you have to be happy with where you are. However, you cannot plan a route to get to where you want to be until you have a starting point.<br><br>You simply have to ask yourself: Where do you want to be next year? And the next? What about five, ten, twenty years down the road? What are your goals? You don't have to have them fully defined for twenty years, but striving to improve sequentially every year needs to be the largest part of your planning.<br><br>When I first started wrestling, I got $10 for my first match. A few days later I wrestled as the main event in front of two thousand people and got $25. Sequentially I was heading the right direction; however, I was also getting screwed.<br><br>The key to being able to do what you want and to work where you want and for how long you want is to be financially independent.

At 63, Hall is mightily productive in poetry, memoir, essay, letter, story, and review, and he sets out to devote part of each working day (for Hall, there are seven of these a week) to writing this book, its title bespeaking its theme. In 1975, we learn, Hall gave up teaching and became a full-time writer, retiring to the farm in Vermont that had once belonged to his grandparents. As the book begins, Hall mourns the recent death of a close friend, preacher, and hard worker; settles on a definition of productive work as a state of ``absorbedness''; touches on history, family, his own literary output, his great love of the work he does, the number of revisions he puts poems through, what time he gets up, what he eats for breakfast and lunch, even when he walks the dog and drops manuscripts off with the typist. A phone call changes the tone of all of this when a routine blood test shows a recurrence of cancer and sends the poet into surgery. A couple of weeks later, facing both chemotherapy and newly diminished odds for living more than another few years, Hall picks up his narrative and--keeps going. Under the deepened shadow of mortality, he writes with eloquent simplicity about the old-fashioned working farm-life of his Vermont grandparents, the declining health of his aging mother, and--with a consummate and moving poise--his father's unhappiness in his own work, and his early death from cancer. History, life, work, art, dedication, love, and courage--all without becoming saccharine or smug or maudlin, in a treasurable small book, poetic in its plainness, about how to live well.

Nineteen-year-old Gwendolyn Hooper steps off a steamer in Ceylon full of optimism, eager to join her new husband. But the man who greets her at the tea plantation is not the same one she fell in love with in London. Distant and brooding, Laurence spends long days wrapped up in his work, leaving his young bride to explore the plantation alone. It&#39;s a place filled with clues to the past - locked doors, a yellowed wedding dress in a dusty trunk, an overgrown grave hidden in the grounds, far too small for an adult... Gwen soon falls pregnant and her husband is overjoyed, but she has little time to celebrate. In the delivery room the new mother is faced with a terrible choice, one she knows no one in her upper class set will understand - least of all Laurence. Forced to bury a secret at the heart of her marriage, Gwen is more isolated than ever. When the time comes, how will her husband ever understand what she has done? The Tea Planter&#39;s Wife is a story of guilt, betrayal and untold secrets vividly and entrancingly set in colonial era Ceylon.</p><p>Dinah Jefferies was born in Malaysia and moved to England at the age of nine. Her idyllic childhood always held a special place in her imagination, and when she began writing novels in her 60s, she was able to return there - first in her fiction and then on annual research trips for each new novel. Dinah Jefferies is the author of four novels, The Separation, The Tea Planter&#39;s Wife - a Number One Sunday Times bestseller, The Silk Merchant&#39;s Daughter and Before the Rains. She lives in Gloucestershire.Part One<br><br>The New Life<br><br>1<br><br>Twelve Years Later: Ceylon, 1925<br><br>With her straw sun hat in one hand, gwen leaned against the salty railings and glanced down again. She&#x2019;d been watching the shifting color of the sea for an hour, tracing the shreds of paper, the curls of orange peel, and the leaves drifting by. Now that the water had changed from deepest turquoise to dingy gray, she knew it couldn&#x2019;t be long. She leaned a little further over the rail to watch a piece of silver fabric float out of sight.<br><br>When the ship&#x2019;s horn sounded&#x2014;loud, prolonged, and very close&#x2014;she jumped, lifting her hand from the rail in surprise. The little satin purse, a farewell present from her mother, with its delicate beaded drawstring, slid over her hand. She gasped and reached out, but saw it was too late as the purse dropped into the ocean, swirled in the dirty water, and then sank. And with it her money, and Laurence&#x2019;s letter with his instructions folded neatly inside.<br><br>She looked about her and felt another stirring of the unease she hadn&#x2019;t been able to shake off since leaving England. You can&#x2019;t get much further from Gloucestershire than Ceylon, her father had said. As his voice echoed in her head, she was startled when she heard another voice, distinctly male but with an unusually honeyed tone.<br><br>&#x201c;New to the East?&#x201d;<br><br>Accustomed to the fact that her violet eyes and pale complexion always attracted attention, she turned to look and was forced to squint into bright sunlight.<br><br>&#x201c;I . . . Yes. I&#x2019;m joining my husband. We&#x2019;re only recently married.&#x201d; She took a breath, just stopping herself from blurting out the whole story.<br><br>A broad-shouldered man of medium height, with a strong nose and glittering caramel eyes, gazed back at her. His black brows, curling hair, and dark polished skin stopped her in her tracks. She stared, feeling a little unnerved, until he smiled in an open sort of way.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky. By May the sea would normally be a great deal wilder. A tea planter, I&#x2019;m guessing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Your husband.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How did you know?&#x201d;<br><br>He spread his hands. &#x201c;There is a type.&#x201d;<br><br>She glanced down at her beige-colored dress: drop-waisted, but with a high collar and long sleeves. She didn&#x2019;t want to be a &#x201c;type,&#x201d; but realized that if it weren&#x2019;t for the chiffon scarf knotted at her neck, she might appear drab.<br><br>&#x201c;I saw what happened. I&#x2019;m sorry about your purse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was stupid of me,&#x201d; she said, and hoped she wasn&#x2019;t blushing.<br><br>Had she been a little more like her cousin, Fran, she might have engaged him in conversation, but instead, imagining the short exchange to be over, she turned back to watch as the ship slipped closer to Colombo.<br><br>Above the shimmering city, a cobalt sky stretched into distant purple hills; trees gave shade and the air was filled with the cries of gulls as they swooped over the small boats massing on the water. The thrill of doing something so different bubbled through her. She had missed Laurence and, for a moment, allowed herself to dream of him. Dreaming was effortless, but the reality was so exciting it set butterflies alight in her stomach. She took a deep breath of what she&#x2019;d expected would be salty air and marveled at the scent of something stronger than salt.<br><br>&#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; she said as she turned to look at the man, who, she rightly sensed, had not shifted from the spot.<br><br>He paused and sniffed deeply. &#x201c;Cinnamon and probably sandalwood.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something sweet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jasmine flowers. There are many flowers in Ceylon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How lovely,&#x201d; she said. But even then, she knew it was more than that. Beneath the seductive scent there was an undercurrent of something sour.<br><br>&#x201c;Bad drains too, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded. Perhaps that was it.<br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t introduced myself. My name is Savi Ravasinghe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re . . . I mean, I haven&#x2019;t seen you at dinner.&#x201d;<br><br>He pulled a face. &#x201c;Not a first-class passenger is what you mean, I think. I&#x2019;m Sinhalese.&#x201d;<br><br>She hadn&#x2019;t noticed until now that the man stood on the other side of the rope that separated the classes. &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s very nice to meet you,&#x201d; she said, pulling off one of her white gloves. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Gwendolyn Hooper.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then you must be Laurence Hooper&#x2019;s new wife.&#x201d;<br><br>She fingered the large Ceylon sapphire of her ring and nodded in surprise. &#x201c;You know my husband?&#x201d;<br><br>He inclined his head. &#x201c;I have met your husband, yes, but now I&#x2019;m afraid I must take my leave.&#x201d;<br><br>She held out her hand, pleased to have met him.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;ll be very happy in Ceylon, Mrs. Hooper.&#x201d;<br><br>When he ignored her hand, she let it fall. He pressed his palms together in front of his chest, fingers pointing upward, and bowed very slightly.<br><br>&#x201c;May your dreams be fulfilled . . .&#x201d; With closed eyes, he paused for a moment, then walked off.<br><br>Gwen felt a little disconcerted by his words and the odd departing gesture, but with more pressing matters on her mind, she shrugged. She really must try to remember Laurence&#x2019;s lost instructions.<br><br>Luckily, first class disembarked first, and that meant her. She thought of the man again and couldn&#x2019;t help but feel fascinated. She&#x2019;d never met anyone so exotic and it would have been much more fun if he&#x2019;d stayed to keep her company&#x2014;though, of course, he could not.<br><br>Nothing had prepared her for the shock of Ceylon&#x2019;s scorching heat, nor its clashing colors, nor the contrast between the bright white light and the depth of the shade. Noise bombarded her: bells, horns, people, and buzzing insects surrounding her, swirling and eddying, until she felt as if she were being tipped about, like one of the pieces of flotsam she&#x2019;d been watching earlier. When the background noise was eclipsed by loud trumpeting, she spun round to stare at the timber wharf, mesmerized by the sight of an elephant raising its trunk in the air and bellowing.<br><br>When watching an elephant had become quite normal, she braved the Port Authority building, made arrangements for her trunk, then sat on a wooden bench in the hot steamy air with nothing but her hat to shade her, and with which, from time to time, she swatted the clusters of flies that crawled along her hairline. Laurence had promised to be at the dockside, but so far there was no sign of him. She tried to recall what he&#x2019;d said to do in the event of an emergency, and spotted Mr. Ravasinghe again, making his way out of the second-class hatch in the side of the ship. By avoiding looking at the man, she hoped to hide her flush of embarrassment at her predicament, and turned the other way to watch the haphazard loading of tea chests onto a barge at the other end of the docks.<br><br>The smell of drains had long since overpowered the spicy fragrance of cinnamon and now mingled with other rank odors: grease, bullock dung, rotting fish. And as the dockside filled with more disgruntled passengers being besieged by traders and hawkers peddling gemstones and silk, she felt sick with nerves. What would she do if Laurence didn&#x2019;t come? He had promised. She was only nineteen, and he knew she&#x2019;d never been further from Owl Tree Manor than a trip or two to London with Fran. Her spirits sank. It was too bad her cousin hadn&#x2019;t been able to travel out with her, but straight after the wedding Fran had been called away by her solicitor, and though Gwen would have entrusted Laurence with her life, all things considered, she couldn&#x2019;t help feeling a bit upset.<br><br>A swarm of seminaked brown-skinned children flitted among the crowd, offering bundles of cinnamon sticks, and with enormous, imploring eyes, begged for rupees. A child who couldn&#x2019;t have been more than five pulled out a bundle for Gwen. She held it to her nose and sniffed. The child spoke, but it was gobbledegook to Gwen, and sadly she had no rupees to give the urchin, nor any English money either, now.<br><br>She stood and walked about. There was a brief gust of wind, and from somewhere in the distance came a troubling sound&#x2014;boom, boom, boom. Drums, she thought. Loud, but not quite loud enough to identify a regular beat. She didn&#x2019;t wander far from the small case she&#x2019;d left by the bench, and when she heard Mr. Ravasinghe call out, she felt her forehead bead with perspiration.<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. Hooper. You cannot leave your case unguarded.&#x201d;<br><br>She wiped her forehead with the back of her hand. &#x201c;I was keeping my eye on it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;People are poor and opportunistic. Come, I&#x2019;ll carry your case and find you somewhere cooler to wait.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re very kind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d; He held her by the elbow with just his fingertips and forged a path through the Port Authority building. &#x201c;This is Church Street. Now look over there&#x2014;just at the edge of Gordon Gardens is the Suriya, or tulip tree as it is known.&#x201d;<br><br>She glanced at the tree. Its fat trunk folded deeply like a woman&#x2019;s skirt, and a canopy studded with bright orange bell-shaped flowers offered an oddly flaming kind of shade.<br><br>&#x201c;It will provide a degree of cool, though with the afternoon heat coming on so strong, and the monsoon not yet arrived, you will find little relief.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need for you to stay with me.&#x201d;<br><br>He smiled and his eyes narrowed. &#x201c;I cannot leave you here alone, a penniless stranger in our city.&#x201d;<br><br>Glad of his company, she smiled back.<br><br>They walked across to the spot he&#x2019;d indicated, and she spent another hour leaning against the tree, perspiring and dripping beneath her clothes, and wondering what she&#x2019;d let herself in for by agreeing to live in Ceylon. The noise had amplified, and though he stood close, hemmed in by the crowds, he still had to shout to be heard.<br><br>&#x201c;If your husband has not arrived by three, I hope you won&#x2019;t mind my suggesting you retire to the Galle Face Hotel to wait. It is airy, there are fans and soft drinks, and you will be infinitely cooler.&#x201d;<br><br>She hesitated, reluctant to leave the spot. &#x201c;But how will Laurence know I&#x2019;m there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll know. Anyone British of any standing goes to the Galle Face.&#x201d;<br><br>She glanced at the imposing fa�ade of the Grand Oriental. &#x201c;Not there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Definitely not there. Trust me.&#x201d;<br><br>In the fierce brightness of the afternoon, the wind blew a cloud of grit into her face, sending tears streaming down her cheeks. She blinked rapidly, then rubbed her eyes, hoping she really could trust him. Perhaps he was right. A person could die in this heat.<br><br>A short distance from where she stood, a tight bundle had formed beneath rows and rows of fluttering white ribbons strung across the street, and a man in brown robes, making a repetitive high-pitched sound, stood in the center of a group of colorful women. Mr. Ravasinghe saw Gwen watching.<br><br>&#x201c;The monk is pirith chanting,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It is often required at the deathbed to ensure a good passing. Here I think it is because great evil may have transpired at that spot, or at the very least a death. The monk is attempting to purify the place of any remaining malignancy by calling for the blessings of the gods. We believe in ghosts in Ceylon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are all Buddhists?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I myself am, but there are Hindus and Muslims too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Christians?&#x201d;<br><br>He inclined his head.<br><br>When by three there was still no sign of Laurence, the man held out a hand and took a step away. &#x201c;Well?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded, and he called out to one of the rickshaw men, who wore very little more than a turban and a greasy-looking loincloth.<br><br>She shuddered at how thin the man&#x2019;s brown naked back was. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surely not going in that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Would you prefer a bullock cart?&#x201d;<br><br>She felt herself redden as she glanced at the heap of oval orange fruits piled up in a cart that had huge wooden wheels and a matted canopy.<br><br>&#x201c;I do beg your pardon, Mrs. Hooper. I shouldn&#x2019;t tease. Your husband uses carts to transport the tea chests. We would actually ride in a small buggy. Just the one bullock and with a shady palm-leaf hood.&#x201d;<br><br>She pointed at the orange fruits. &#x201c;What are those?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;King coconut. Only for the juice. Are you thirsty?&#x201d;<br><br>Even though she was, she shook her head. On the wall just behind Mr. Ravasinghe, a large poster showed a dark-skinned woman balancing a wicker basket on her head and wearing a yellow and red sari. She had bare feet and gold bangles on her ankles and she wore a yellow headscarf. mazzawattee tea, the poster proclaimed. Gwen&#x2019;s hands grew clammy and a flood of sickening panic swept through her. She was very far from home.<br><br>&#x201c;As you can see,&#x201d; Mr. Ravasinghe was saying, &#x201c;cars are few and far between, and a rickshaw is certainly faster. If you are unhappy, we can wait, and I&#x2019;ll try to obtain a horse and carriage. Or, if it helps, I can accompany you in the rickshaw.&#x201d;<br><br>At that moment, a large black car came hooting its way through the crowd of pedestrians, bicyclists, carts, and carriages, only narrowly missing numerous sleeping dogs. Laurence, she thought with a surge of relief, but when she looked in through the window of the passing vehicle, she saw it contained only two large middle-aged European women. One turned to look at Gwen, her face a picture of disapproval.<br><br>Right, Gwen thought, galvanized into action, a rickshaw it is.<br><br>A cluster of thin palms stood waving in the breeze outside the Galle Face Hotel, and the building itself sided the ocean in a very British way. When Mr. Ravasinghe had given her the oriental manner of salutation and a very warm smile, she was sorry to see him go but walked past the two curved staircases and settled herself to wait in the relative cool of the Palm Lounge. She instantly felt at home and closed her eyes, pleased to have a small respite from the almost total invasion of her senses. Her rest didn&#x2019;t last long. If Laurence were to arrive now, she was only too aware of the sorry state she was in, and that was not the impression she wanted to create. She sipped her cup of Ceylon tea, and then looked across the tables and chairs dotted about the polished teak floor. In one corner a discreet sign pinpointed the location of the ladies&#x2019; powder room.<br><br>In the sweet-smelling, multiple-mirrored room, she splashed the repeated image of her face and applied a dab of Apr�s L&#x2019;Ond�e, which luckily had been safely stowed in her small case and not in her drowned purse. She felt sticky, with sweat running down under her arms, but pinned up her hair again so that it coiled neatly at the nape of her neck. Her hair was her crowning glory, Laurence said. It was dark, long, and ringleted when unpinned. When she&#x2019;d mentioned she was considering having it cut short like Fran&#x2019;s, flapper style, he&#x2019;d looked horrified and tugged loose a curl at the back of her neck, then leaned down and rubbed his chin on top of her head.</p><h2>Anxiety &amp; Depression For Dummies (Pocket Edition)</h2><p>This book has folded &amp; wrinkled pages.</p><p></p><h2>The Great Spring: Writing, Zen, and This Zigzag Life</h2><p><b>From beloved writing teacher and author of the best-selling&nbsp;Writing Down the Bones: a treasury of personal stories reflecting a life filled with journeys&#x2014;inner and outer&#x2014;zigzagging around the world and home again.</b><br><br>Here, Natalie Goldberg, "a writer both energized and enlightened" (Julia Cameron), shares those vivid moments that have wakened her to new ways of being.

Ever since the Rothschild&#39;s spectacular rise to preeminence in European finance during the last, turbulent years of the Napoleonicwars, a mythology has grown up around the family and it&#39;s firms. It is no exaggeration to say that the Rothschilds became 1 of theliving legends of the 19th century: the personfication of a new era in which money determined status and power, an era in which 5 Jewish brothers born into the wretchedness of the Frnakfurt Ghetto could rise by their own ingenuity to become &#39; the worlds bankers&#39; - dominating the international financial markets, rubbing shoulders with the social elite, patronising the great artists and architects of the era and above all exerting a decisive, if veiled, influence over the world&#39;s monarchs and statesmen. Using a wealth of archival sources as well as a vast amount of little known contemporary and more recent secondary literature, Niall Ferguson&#39;s definitive study will finally hold the mirror of reality up to the face of myth. The result promises not only to do justice to the history of Rothschilds, but to revolutionise the history of the years of their rise and preeminence, and to reveal fascinating continuities from the 19th century to our own time.</p><p></p><h2>Make Your Dreams Bigger Than Your Memories: Don&#39;t Let Your Past Keep You From Your Future</h2><p>We all have a past. We&#39;ve all made mistakes and done things we wish we hadn&#39;t done. We all wish we could just push a &#34;delete&#34; button on some of the choices we made yesterday and some of the things we&#39;ve experienced years ago. What&#39;s more, our past has a way of shaping who we are today. It&#39;s amazing how one single dramatic experience of rejection in childhood can last through adulthood and forever alter our self-image or how one bad decision in college can overshadow the dreams of the future, even God-given dreams. Terri Savelle Foy knows that past hurts (whether brought on by someone else or our choice to sin) can undermine us. Raised a church kid, she knew all about sin but made the mistakes anyway. She learned firsthand that it&#39;s not until we truly get a revelation of who we are in Christ, and apply it to our lives, that our past can be erased and our dreams become real again. Terri shows how we can let go of our past, change our self-image and confidently move into a future with hope.</p><p>Holding on to the past and all its mistakes will only hinder you from taking hold of the future that God has planned for you. But it can be so hard to let it go! That&#x2019;s why you must dream extraordinary dreams. When you focus your mind and heart on reaching your God-given goals, the past cannot hold you prisoner any longer.<br> In Make Your Dreams Bigger Than Your Memories, Terri Savelle Foy shares her personal journey out of a painful past into total freedom and walks with you, step by step, along the path to God&#x2019;s purpose for you. Your past does not define your future . . . so stop living as if it does! Turn your back on guilt, shame and regret to face the reality of God&#x2019;s love and the promise of His plans for you.&nbsp;<b>Terri Savelle Foy</b> is known across the globe as a world-class motivator of hope and success through her transparent and humorous teaching style.

By 1860 railroads were firmly entrenched in our culture, reshaping our cities and steering us through the industrial age towards worldwide prominence. From sleepy post towns to the largest east coast cities, the distant hooting of the locomotive whistle drew ever closer and louder, filling listeners with fascination while brightening the eyes of profit-driven industrialists. But this admirable invention, lavishly adorned in brass and iron trimmings, was about to take on a new and deadly role. America&#x2019;s regional differences would result in a spectacular collision over slavery, and between 1861&#x2013;1865, the nation fought a savage war. The &#x201c;iron horse&#x201d; became a major weapon in the first war fully dependent on railroads. Moreover railroads would escalate and prolong the war, leading to its terrible carnage. Trains were used to move troops rapidly and over great distances, completely changing military strategy. Trains were also used as mobile artillery, armed with large-caliber cannons that could pound cities and fortifications. Trains were a crucial means for supplying the armies on both sides, and it was the severing of the railway lines providing food and munitions to the Army of Northern Virginia that led to Robert E. Lee&#x2019;s surrender at Appomattox Court House. <br></p><p><i>In Railroads of the Civil War: An Illustrated History,</i> Michael Leavy uses compelling period photographs and drawings and a rich narrative to reevaluate and illuminate the role of railroads in the Civil War.

By 1793 Toussaint had emerged as the leader of the revolt, proving himself to be as adept at politics as he was on the battlefield. By 1801 he had succeeded in stabilizing the war-ravaged territory and invited exiled white planters, whose expertise was needed, to return and reclaim their properties. The foundation of a society based on liberty, genuine equality, and brotherhood among whites, blacks, and mulattos seemed in place. But the proclamation of a new constitution that abolished slavery and appointed Toussaint governor for life incited Napoleon to dispatch troops in order to reestablish control over the island. <br>The Stone That the Builder Refused spans the final phase of Toussaint's career and paints an astonish-ingly detailed and riveting portrait of a new society breaking forth from the chrysalis of a revolution, of the vision that impelled Toussaint to create a society based on principle and idealism, and of the dreadful compromises he was forced to make in order to <br>preserve it. <br>A masterly weave of the factual and the imagined, this grand culmination of Bell's landmark Toussaint Louverture trilogy stands alone as a towering achievement of historical fiction.Madison Smartt Bell is the author of fifteen works of fiction, including <i>Master of the Crossroads</i>; <i>All Souls&#x2019; Rising</i>;<i> Save Me, Joe Louis</i>; <i>Doctor Sleep</i>; <i>Soldier's Joy</i>; and <i>Ten Indians</i>.

Born in the Allegheny West neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and raised in Oakland, California, Stein moved to Paris in 1903, and made France her home for the remainder of her life. She hosted a Paris salon, where the leading figures of modernism in literature and art, such as Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, F.

Novelist and poet Millman followed the Vikings' route from Norway to Newfoundland and Labrador, journeying by ferry, mail boat and cargo vessel to the Shetlands, Faeroes and Iceland, with side trips to isolated islands (Foua, Grimsey). From Iceland, he flew to a former air base in Greenland, where he explored Viking sites in the south on both coasts. Flying to Newfoundland, he traveled by ferry to Goose Bay, Labrador; in this lonely place, peace was shattered by NATO planes running test flights into the interior. Returning to Newfoundland by ferry, Millman completed his journey at the Vikings' last-known settlement, L'Anse aux Meadows. The volume paints a bleak portrait of such dwellings, especially in Greeland, of a primitive people no longer self-sufficient, herded into ghettos. The author tells also of the region's natural wildness, embattled at times by humans: he witnessed whale-bashing in the Faeroes and endured attacks by nesting skuas in the Shetlands. Millman's descriptive writing borders on the florid, but he captures the beauty and fragility of an austere landscape.

Here, (distilled from the experiences and observations of one who fought with them in the British infantry unit) is the mood of those who fought and died at Anzio. Their task - to seize the Alban Hills and then Rome forty miles away. Instead, for more than four months, they sank into the mud of the Anzio plain and fought for their lives. Nothing has appeared since Erich Maria Remarque&#39;s ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT that can compare with this book&#39;s ability to penetrate the minds of men at war. There are no heroes, no heroines, no victories. This is a faceless, nameless, fragmented war. Even national differences - Britain, Italian, German, American - merge and are forgotten in this larger story of humanity. This story, in fact, does not need to be Anzio; it could be any battlefield where man has faced death.</p><p><p>From his birth in 1916 until he ran away to London, William Woodruff lived<br>in the heart of Blackburn's weaving community.

But when his aloof Florentine girlfriend of some years dumped him unceremoniously, he found himself at a crossroads. Abandoning the world of libraries and the future he had always imagined for himself, he headed off instead for Spain in search of duende, the intense emotional state - part ecstasy, part desperation - so intrinsic to flamenco. DUENDE is an account of his years spent in Spain feeding his obsessive interest in flamenco: he subjects himself to the tyranny of his guitar teacher, practising for hours on end until his fingers bleed; he becomes involved in a passionate affair with Lola, a flamenco dancer (and older woman) married to the gun-toting Vicente, only to flee Alicante in fear of his life; in Madrid, he falls in with Gypsies and meets the imperious Jes?s. Joining their dislocated, cocaine-fuelled world, stealing cars by night and sleeping away the days in tawdry rooms, he finds himself spiralling self-destructively downwards. It is only when he arrives in Granada bruised and battered, after two years total immersion in the flamenco lifestyle that he is able to put his obsession into context. In the tradition of Laurie Lee&#39;s classic AS I WALKED OUT ONE MIDSUMMER MORNING, DUENDE charts a young man&#39;s emotional coming of age and offers real insight into the passionate essence of flamenco.</p><p>&#x201c;In this enjoyable Spanish travel memoir...Webster...fluidly interlac[es] his foreigner&#x2019;s perspective with edgy and often perilous cravings to live of a genuine flamenco guitarist...Webster deserves praise for verbalizing an emotion that most people can only feel or imagine.&#x201d; &#x2013;<b><i>Publishers Weekly<br><br></i></b>&#x201c;A journey into the heart of flamenco, it is as vivid and colorful as an Almodovar film; it&#x2019;ll leave you with a burning desire to head for Spain.&#x201d; &#x2013;<b><i>Time Out</i> (London)</b><br><br>&#x201c;There are three great non-fiction books about Spain written by Englishmen.

Bram was the son of an elephant trainer, Modoc the daughter of his prize performer. The boy and animal grew up devoted to each other. When the Wunderzircus was sold to an American, with no provision to take along the human staff, Bram stowed away on the ship to prevent being separated from his beloved Modoc. A shipwreck off the Indian coast and a sojourn with a maharajah were only the beginning of the pair's incredible adventures. They battled bandits, armed revolutionaries, cruel animal trainers, and greedy circus owners in their quest to stay together. They triumphed against the odds and thrilled American circus audiences with Modoc's dazzling solo performances, only to be torn apart with brutal suddenness, seemingly never to meet again. Hollywood animal trainer Ralph Helfer rescued Modoc from ill-treatment and learned her astonishing story when Bram rediscovered her at Helfer's company.

The 15 myths here, based upon the 13th-century Icelandic Prose Edda, will be familiar to readers of Norse mythology, and include "The Creation," "The Walls of Asgard," "Thor's Hammer," and "The Death of Balder." Philip's versions are straightforward in tone, yet retain an air of wonder. While they can be read as exciting adventures, they never lose the element of sacredness inherent in mythology. Contributing to this aura are Foa's dramatic illustrations. Created by applying thin layers of opaque oil paint to a white surface, the full-page paintings, at least one per tale, possess a primitive, almost surreal look. The artist's depictions of animals and humans are reminiscent of the work of Expressionists such as Marc Chagall and Georges Roualt. Her palette, filled with colors such as black, dark red, yellow ochre, and Chagall blue, looks as if she's borrowed it from Gothic stained-glass windows. Philip includes an afterword and a helpful "Who's Who" of the Norse gods and goddesses with some pronunciation guidance. With its dynamic illustrations and more descriptive text, Mary Pope Osborne's Favorite Norse Myths (Scholastic, 1996) may have wider appeal. But independent readers who find Philip's collection may leave it with a greater understanding of the culture that produced such amazing myths.<br><i>Denise Anton Wright, Illinois State University, Normal</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.A retelling of Norse mythology, from creation to Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods, including stories about Odin, Loki, Thor, and the giants of Jotunheim. Philip (Singing America, 1995, etc.) adds little that is new to the already considerable body of Norse myths available for young readers, but his competent retellings retain an elegant formality. A ``Who's Who'' puts the gods in their places, while the afterword contains interesting information about the Poetic and Prose Eddas, and about Christian influences and parallels. Foa's striking oil paintings have a look best described as somewhere between colored woodcuts and cave paintings; her unusual approach gives the book a quality of something ancient rediscovered, wholly appropriate to the subject. They make the book extraordinary. (further reading) (Folklore. 10+) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Mark Twain) has a dream: to build a riverboat that will rival the most magnificent paddle-wheelers ever navigated on the mighty Mississippi. Then, to steer it up the endless waterway that dominates his new home planet--and at last discover its hidden source.<br><br>But before he can carry out his plan, he first must undertake a dangerous voyage to unearth a fallen meteor. This mission would require striking an uneasy alliance with the bloodthirsty Viking Erik Bloodaxe, treacherous King John of England, legendary French swordsman Cyrano de Bergerac, Greek adventurer Odysseus, and the infamous Nazi Hermann G�ring. All for the purpose of storming the ominous stone tower at the mouth of the river, where the all-powerful overseers of Riverworld--and their secrets--lie in wait . . .</p><p>In <i>To Your Scattered Bodies Go</i>, Philip Jos� Farmer introduces readers to the awesome Riverworld, a planet that had been carved into one large river on whose shores all of humanity throughout the ages has seemingly been resurrected. In <i>The Fabulous Riverboat</i>, Farmer tells the tale of one person whose is uniquely suited to find the river's headwaters, riverboat captain and famous Earthly author Sam Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain). Clemens has been visited by "X," a mysterious being who claims to be a rebel among the group that created Riverworld. X tells Clemens where he can find a large deposit of iron and other materials that Clemens can use to build the greatest riverboat ever seen. Since there is virtually no metal on the planet, it will also give Clemens an unbeatable edge when it comes to battling the various warlike societies that dominate the Riverworld.<p> But Clemens is not alone in his quest for the iron, which arrives on the planet in the form of a giant meteorite. In fact, Clemens is besieged on all sides by forces determined to seize the precious ore, leading him to make a deadly pact with one of history's most notorious villains, John Lackland. Lackland's crimes during his reign as king of England were so hideous that no other English monarch will ever carry his name, and he's up to equally nefarious tricks on Riverworld. However, Clemens has a guardian angel in the form of Joe Miller, a giant subhuman with a big nose, a serious lisp, and a cutting wit. Miller has also been to the very headwaters of the river, where he saw a mysterious tower in the middle of the North Sea and where the creators of Riverworld are thought to reside. He will be an invaluable ally in completing the riverboat and sailing to the headwaters, but even an 800-pound giant may not be enough to help Clemens fulfill X's mission. <i>--Craig E.

Her family stood outside the door, excited and chattering as they waited for her to emerge in all her pristine white glory. David posed at the front of the church in his tux, with the priest and his best man flanking his side. She imagined his beautifully tousled golden hair, killer smile, and sparkling green eyes. Perfect, as usual. While she was getting dressed, a delivery had arrived at the house. Two dozen white roses with just the faintest tinge of pink in the centers. The card read: I cannot wait until you are finally mine.<br> <br>Her bridal party sighed with pleasure. Her twin sister, Isabella, rolled her eyes and clutched her neck in mockery of gagging to death. She&#x2019;d been quietly shushed by the others while everyone held their breath, hoping she&#x2019;d remain manageable until at least after the ceremony. It had been a rocky road between the sisters, so that Izzy even bothering to don a bridesmaid dress was a miracle. Gen&#x2019;s best friend, Kate, hurriedly put the roses in water until they stood straight and proud in the center of the dining room table amid a group of giggling, excited women. Her sister Alexa teased her husband about not receiving a thing on her big day, which brought on a tirade of groaning from Nick and her dad whining about how reality television had given women false expectations of real romance.<br> <br>Gen kept smiling, murmured the correct responses, and held the card in a death grip. Then she ran to the bathroom, trying desperately not to vomit.<br> <br>Not the best reaction for a bride-to-be. Of course, she chalked it up to nerves, ignored her nausea, and got her ass into the stretch limo. She nodded and responded to her chattering bridal party. As the limousine gobbled up the miles and sped toward the church, her brain clicked over the final details, worrying if she missed anything. David hated sloppiness of any sort, and with almost three hundred guests, it was an important enough event to guarantee press and some high-society attendees. She&#x2019;d wanted a wedding planner, but David insisted on keeping it private and personal. Of course she agreed; it would be nice to say they did it all themselves instead of relying on a stranger. Exhaustion beat into her bones, but Gen pushed it back. Yes, she&#x2019;d done absolutely everything, triple-checking each detail for the past few days nonstop.<br> <br>From the apricot bridesmaid dresses in silk so light the fabric shimmered, to the exquisite ribbon-wrapped orchids, the bridal party was breathtaking. The venue had been almost impossible to secure without the right contacts on just a year&#x2019;s notice. The castle in Tarrytown boasted stunning gardens, soaring architecture with vaulted ceilings, a banquet hall to rival Buckingham Palace, and French cuisine. Sure, she would&#x2019;ve rather been married at Mohonk Mountain House near her parents in a more relaxed, fun atmosphere, but at least David agreed to the church ceremony. And she&#x2019;d won the argument insisting Izzy stay in the wedding. David may not approve of her, but Gen stood her ground, and now her entire family was by her side.<br> <br>The limo pulled in. She ducked her head against the flash of photographers, and Kate helped her with the massive pearl-encrusted train spilling onto the sidewalk. The Vera Wang gown was ridiculously pricey and reminded her of someone else, but it was the stuff princesses and brides were made of. Lace, tulle, diamonds, and pearls. Too bad she couldn&#x2019;t breathe.<br> <br>She kept it together in the back room of the church while her mother cried, straightened her veil, and told her she&#x2019;d never been more proud. Alexa beamed with joy, and her beautiful niece, Lily, looked like a fairy princess with her basket of petals and mini ballroom dress to match the bride&#x2019;s. Her other niece, Taylor, glowed in her junior bridal dress, a delicate pale pink exactly like the center of the roses. Gina, her sister-in-law, winked and announced the bride needed a moment alone before walking down the aisle. Gen almost sagged with relief, and finally the door shut. Blessed silence filled the room.<br> <br>Everything was perfect, just like it should be.<br> <br>Perfect. Like David always wanted it.<br> <br>Gen panted and tried to get herself together. The murmur of voices and organ music drifted from the door. She stumbled to the gorgeously painted stained-glass window of Madonna and child and yanked on the knob. Stuck. �Dizziness threatened. Crapola, she needed air, right now. Her French-manicured fingers wrapped around the old-�fashioned handle and pulled frantically. Light exploded off the pristine diamond weighing down her knuckle. Finally, a few inches opened up and she bent her head toward the gap, sucking in hot air. Why, oh why did she have to wait until now to completely freak out? Maybe all the wedding stress had finally gotten to her. She&#x2019;d open the door, walk down the aisle with her head held high, and say her vows. She loved David. Who wouldn&#x2019;t? He treated her like a queen, told her every day how much she meant to him, and pushed her to be better. Always better. They&#x2019;d be the envied power couple of their time&#x2014;surgeons who saved lives, attended charity functions, and changed the world. They were madly in love.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t wait until you are finally mine.<br> <br>A shiver crept down her spine. She looked down at the flawless three-carat diamond ring that shimmered around her finger. A symbol of ownership. Once she committed herself, it would truly be forever. He&#x2019;d never let her go.<br> <br>Run.<br> <br>The inner voice that had been squashed for so long in fear of retaliation rose up from her gut and screamed one last word. Gen clutched at the windowsill. Ridiculous. She couldn&#x2019;t run.<br> <br>Right? People only did that in the movies. Besides, she couldn&#x2019;t do that to David.<br> <br>Run.<br> <br>The past two years with David had taught her to sift through her rioting emotions and connect with the core of rationality that hid in every person&#x2019;s center. Her fianc� despised messiness, impulse, and decisions based on emotion. He cited death and destruction time and again, until she&#x2019;d finally managed to quiet that crazy voice that had once sung in freedom, slightly off-key but always joyous. Gen figured she&#x2019;d beaten it back so hard, in fear and determination, that she&#x2019;d never hear from it again. But of course, with her lousy luck, it had taken this moment of all moments to reassert its independence and general brattiness.<br> <br>Run before it&#x2019;s too late.<br> <br>Her brain spun in a mad rush. Not much time left. Once her family came in, it was over. They&#x2019;d calm her down, term it bridal jitters, and escort her down the aisle. She&#x2019;d marry David. And she&#x2019;d never be the same again.<br> <br>Which would be good, right? She wanted marriage. Forever. Commitment. With David.<br> <br>Gen looked behind at the closed door. The action she took in the next few seconds would set her on a course that would change the rest of her life. She didn&#x2019;t have time to go over the checks and balances, advantages and disadvantages, and make a neat statistical chart. Instead, she dug deep into her gut that had served her well when faced with a child bleeding on her table: life-and-death decisions that even David couldn&#x2019;t make her stop because it made up the center of her soul. A future surgeon. A woman. A survivor.<br> <br>Run.<br> <br>Gen didn&#x2019;t waste another moment.<br> <br>Breathing hard, heart pounding, she shoved the crank around and around until it wouldn&#x2019;t budge another inch. The window gaped halfway open. The judging eyes of baby Jesus beamed down at her. She could do this. For the first time it paid to be Hobbit size. Gen stuck her upper body through the window, leaned forward, and wriggled her way to freedom.</p><h2>Meridian: A Novel of Kit Carson&#39;s West</h2><p>Bradford Stone, cartographer and artist, comes to Bent&#39;s Fort on the Arkansas River in 1845 to join John C. Fremont&#39;s Third Expedition and, in particular, to meet and work with the man who has been his hero all his life, Kit Carson.</p><p>Norman Zollinger of Albuquerque, New Mexico, recipient of the Owen Wister Award from Western Writers of America for lifelong contributions to Western literature, is author of such Forge novels as <i>Not of War Only, Chapultepec,</i> and <i>Meridian.</i><br>Captain John C. Fr&#x201a;mont's 1845 topographical expedition to California and the US war with Mexico serve as the backdrops for an engaging tale of a young America's westering imperatives. Soon after joining the force gathering along the Arkansas River for Fr&#x201a;mont's third trek west of the 100th meridian, Bradford Stone, a young Harvard grad with mapmaking skills and artistic gifts, is befriended by Kit Carson, his boyhood idol. Before their journey starts, the legendary trapper takes him home to Taos, where he meets and falls in love with Ana Barrag&nbsp;n, the spirited daughter of a local grandee. Though promised to Luis Aragon, a new amigo of Brad's, she reciprocates his ardor, and he unwittingly leaves lovely Ana great with child. On the trail with Carson and Fr&#x201a;mont, the greenhorn proves his mettle in deadly clashes with marauding Indians. After much adventure and hardship, the half-starved explorers reach California, which is awash in rumors that the US and Mexico are at war. Under the command of Fr&#x201a;mont, Brad participates in the Bear Flag Rebellion and other comic-opera campaigns. Sent back east with dispatches after more than a year in the wilderness, he learns his beloved Ana (who was hastily married off to Luis) has died in mysterious circumstances along with her infant son. Although heartbroken, he accepts a post as aide to the military governor of New Mexico. Brad also renews acquaintance with Luis and, at the risk of his life, rides hell for leather out of Santa Fe to warn Taos of an upcoming revolt. He plays a role in suppressing this bloody insurrection and has a final confrontation with Don Bernardo Barrag&nbsp;n, one its leaders. Zollinger (Chapultepec, 1995, etc.) brings his characters- -especially the estimable Carson and charismatic Fr&#x201a;mont--to vivid life in a historical setting suffused in violence and romance. A fine tale of Americans along their way toward manifest destiny. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In his own words, John Ashcroft shares his unique perspective on the dangers to and within America from outside forces and explains what he did to repair the serious breaches in the country&#39;s security.</p><p>John Ashcroft served as attorney general of the United States from January 2001 to February 2005. Prior to his appointment, he served in the United States Senate and as the governor of Missouri.As a governor, senator, and attorney general, John Ashcroft never shied away from controversy, and he remains one of most polarizing figures of President George W. Bush's tenure. In NEVER AGAIN, Ashcroft offers opponents and supporters alike the rare opportunity to learn more about how 9/11, the Patriot Act, the execution of Timothy McVeigh, and other tragic and controversial events affected him politically and personally. Ashcroft addresses these issues and events candidly and without apology. He is a surprisingly animated reader, who allows his emotions to show. This straightforward style adds to the book's appeal, especially when Ashcroft offers his unfiltered perspective on how these events will impact American and global security in the short- and long-term.

This is Chris Harrison's hilarious and captivating story of leaving his previous life for La Dolce Vita - that quintessentially Italian seductive way of life, with its luscious foods, physical beauty and sun-drenched vistas. <br><br>On a trip to Dublin, Chris falls head over heels in love with Daniela, an Italian girl with eyes the colour of Guinness, and follows her to her small home town of Andrano on the coast of Puglia.

Along the way he introduces us to a cast of eccentric characters: a policeman who rearranges crimes to suit the necessary forms, a doctor who prescribes patients his homemade lemon liqueur, and - the biggest challenge of all - Daniela's mamma, who's determined to convert Chris to the Catholic faith, supervise his choice of underwear, and build a second storey on her stucco home where the couple might live happily ever after. <br><br>Can this relationship with Southern Italy possibly survive or will the sweet life turn sour?</p><p>Chris Harrison is a London-based journalist and English teacher.

In other words, he is concerned with the great dichotomies - to say nothing of the conflicting ideals and contrasting personalities - which make the history of the medieval papacy so dramatic and instructive. Professor Barraclough's writings on papal history cover a period of more than thirty years. They are based on extensive research in the Vatican Archives and other major manuscript libraries.

Not only is this idea incorrect, it would probably astound the ancient magicians if they heard it! The magicians of 1000 or even 100 years ago were, first and foremost, experimenters. These men and women tried new things and interpreted the actions of those who had gone before in new ways - the ways of their times. Magic should not become static and unchanging. It should be reinterpreted in new ways for each generation. Certainly we should learn from the past, but we should recreate magic, using the latest scientific and philosophical techniques and methods. This is what Donald Tyson has done in his book The New Magus. It is a practical framework on which a student can base his or her personal system of magic. This book is filled with practical, usable magical techniques and rituals which anyone from any magical tradition can use. It includes instructions on how to design and perform rituals, create and use sigils, do invocations and evocations, do spiritual healings, learner rune magic, use god-forms, create telesmatic images, discover your personal guardian, create and use magical tools and much more. You will learn how YOU can be a New Magus! The New Age is based on ancient concepts that have been put into terms, or metaphors, that are appropriate to life in our world today. If you have found that magic seems illogical, overcomplicated and not appropriate to your lifestyle, The New Magus is the book for you. It will change your ideas of magic forever! --- from publisher&#39;s note</p><p></p><h2>A Price for Everything (Rosamunde Pilcher&#39;s Book Shelf)</h2><p><br>From the introduction by Rosamunde Pilcher:<br><br>"<i>A Price for Everything </i>is linked, from start to finish, by Mary Sheepshanks' humor and a rare sense of the ridiculous which bubble up at the least likely moments.

How can Sonia, Lady Duntan so fiercely love such a monster of a house, almost as much as she loves her four children, perhaps more than she loves her husband, whose family has lived at Duntan for over 200 years?<br><br>For Sonia, restoring Duntan to its former glory has become synonymous with repairing her own sense of self, and refurbishing the house means working closely with Simon Hadleigh, the charming director of the Heritage at Risk Association. But as her marriage seems to be crumbling faster than the house itself; her children growing up quickly; her painting career taking off and Simon awakening in her a long, dormant passion, Sonia realizes that everything has its price...<br><br></p><p><br>Born and brought up at Eton where her father was a housemaster, Mary Sheepshanks began writing as a child and published her first poem when she was seventeen years of age. Not unlike her heroine, she and her husband took over the family estate in Yorkshire. This is her first novel.<br><br>An amusing though featherweight romp through the English countryside, this time pitting the love for husband against love for manor house, with predictable results. Young and lovely Sonia, the Lady Duntan, is an enviable superwoman--she has four energetic children, a houseful of dogs, a career as an artist, the lovable Minnie, who tends to the children and meals, and, finally, the breathtaking ancestral home of her husband. And, in truth, much of the guilty delight in this debut novel comes from the vicarious thrill delivered by Sheepshanks's description of such an idyllic life. There's a serpent in this Eden, however, in the form of husband Archie. Though not a bad chap, Archie refuses to support Sonia's dreams of restoring the old house, which is literally crumbling down around the family and is too costly to maintain. Archie's stubbornness, coupled with his not-so-clandestine affair with torrid neighbor Rosie, has Sonia ready to wage war. Thrown into the battle is Archie's gold-digging, globe-trotting mother, who has decided to claim the house as a refuge for her newest interest, the cult-like Brotherhood of Love. Sonia's last hope is the Heritage at Risk Foundation, an organization that may be willing to pay for repairs if the house is opened to the public. Woven through Sheepshanks's leisurely descriptions of country life from village vicar to arrangements for the shooting season, is the record of Sonia's burgeoning romance with the Foundation's director. The story ends with a hammer-and- nails description of the Duntan house restoration, along with the happy voices of children in the background. An enjoyably insubstantial look at the British upper crust and its desperate attempts to keep its houses together, both literally and figuratively. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now a national park renowned for its isolation and untamed natural beauty, Isle Royale was home to a vibrant fishing community from its settlement during the 1880s by Norwegian and Swedish immigrants until the collapse of Lake Superior commercial fishing in the 1950s. Full of historical photographs and diagrams of now derelict watercraft, A Good Boat Speaks for Itself tells the story of this unique community through its wooden boats and the stories of those who built and used them. <p>Timothy Cochrane and Hawk Tolson interviewed dozens of men and women who fished the lake and built the boats that made this life possible. Through these accounts they trace the evolution of this maritime community through the various boat designs used over the years on Isle Royale. From the original Mackinaw sailboats to the gas boats and herring skiffs developed specifically for the harsh conditions of Lake Superior, these wooden boats incorporated Old World traditions of handicraft and pioneering New World technologies. They were an extension of the fishermen who relied on them, helping them to navigate miles out on the open lake in both "dirty weather" and on bright clear days, and were part of a family tradition in which for generations fathers taught sons how to fish, what to look for in a boat, and how to eke out a living from the "Big Lake." </p><p>A Good Boat Speaks for Itself is an absorbing chronicle of fishing families who adapted to the rigors of Lake Superior and a valuable historical resource for anyone with an interest in wooden boats. </p><p>Timothy Cochrane is superintendent of Grand Portage National Monument on the border of Minnesota and Ontario. He has worked as a folklorist, oral historian, and ranger at Isle Royale. Hawk Tolson has been a freelance archaeologist since 1985, and has participated in projects across the Great Lakes, Southwest, Gulf Coast, and Caribbean.

Not just any boat, but a beautiful wooden sailboat. This despite the fact that he barely knew how to sail and that he was the master of so few woodworking skills that it was frightening. The Year of the Boat is a memoir about what when on in that suburban garage&#x2014;a roiling process of measuring, cutting, gluing and sanding that was punctuated with supreme satisfaction, utter frustration, and plain bewilderment. From figuring out how to actually read a set of marine blueprints to learning the fine art of applying epoxy to getting the mast to stand up straight, this is a captivating adventure into the wilderness of doing it yourself. The author tacks an intelligently digressive route as he touches on such topics as the invention of the retractable keel, the esteemed tradition of garage enterprises (think Hewlett Packard), the Platonic ideal sailboat, the hegemonic rise of fiberglass, and the pleasing shape of a rudder. Building a boat turns out to be the antidote for chronic perfectionism (hence the boat&#x2019;s name, Far From Perfect).</p><p>Lawrence W.

During the 1840s, when he led four expeditions into the American West, that era&#39;s penny press and admiring historians accorded Fr�mont the sobriquet The Pathfinder. The ultimate curse of being a national hero is that once the fires of acclaim go out, only the ashes of criticism remain. This was the fate of John Charles Fr�mont, for he climbed the peaks of glory to endure the deserts of despair. How this extraordinary man, illegitimate son of a French exile and a Virginia aristocrat, found his way from the obscurity of genteel poverty to the dizzying heights of national acclaim is one of the great stories in American history. Drawing on much previously unavailable material, Ferol Egan tells that remarkable story in the first full-scale biography of the great explorer. The result is a detailed picture of a unique man in a unique time and place, whose rise to power and fame shows the young United States in its brightest and most revealing aspects. But the story of Fr�mont&#39;s fall from glory reveals the darker side of a nation whose restless spirit spawned imperialist dreams - despite murderous internal strife - that seemed to encompass not only the new western boundaries, but the setting sun itself. Explorer, scientist, military governor of California, U.S. senator, first Republican candidate for President, spearhead for the doctrine of Manifest Destiny - Fr�mont knew the taste of almost every gift the hand of Success could bestow, including physical beauty and the love of one of the most desirable women of the time. In these pages, we see him as he moved through the scenes that were to shape - and ultimately destroy - his career. The back of the book includes extensive Notes to Pages, a bibliographic essay, and an extensive index.</p><p>As a native Californian from Gold Rush country, Ferol Egan developed a love for the American West at an early age. A writer, retired teacher, and historian, Egan is the author of six books including Fremont: Explorer for a Restless Nation, for which he won the Gold Medal for nonfiction from the Commonwealth Club of California. He received the Silver Medal for Sand in a Whirlwind and the California Medal for The El Dorado Trail. He now resides in Berkeley, California.&#34;A large wide-eyed, genuinely exciting book. [Egan] succeeds in showing exploration as creative initiative rather than individual escapism... It scores as grand storytelling.&#34; - Kirkus Reviews &#34;Ferol Egan has maintained a remarkable objectivity, avoiding the trap befalling many biographers who identify and sympathize with their subject... Few contemporary Western writers possess both the patience and the skill to combine a scholarly methodology and apparatus with the effective, readable prose that characterizes the work of Ferol Egan. This massive volume can best be described as a monumental contribution.

Roped into chauffeuring his grandma and dying grandfather on weekly adventures, he realized that, sixty-three years later, they were still madly in love."Now, that's the marriage I want!" he said to himself.<p>Fired up to find more success stories, Mat talked his best friend, Jason Miller, a clueless commitmentphobe, into joining him on a cross-country search for America's greatest marriages, which they called "Project Everlasting." The two bumbling bachelors jumped in an RV and embarked on a 12,000-mile adventure, encompassing the beaches of Los Angeles, the skyscrapers of Manhattan, the bayous of Louisiana, and the mountains of Montana, to discover what it takes to make love last -- not from Ph.D.s or therapists but from more than 200 real couples who had walked the walk to more than forty years of marriage.</p><p>In <i>Project Everlasting</i>, they share their wisdom. Each chapter is dedicated to one of the pressing quest ions the bachelors asked the couples, such as:</p><p></p><ul> <li>"How do you know you've found The One?"</li> <li>"What's missing from today's marriages?"</li> <li>"How do you keep the romance alive?"</li> <li>"What's the most important ingredient for a solid marriage?"</li></ul><p>The couples opened their hearts and homes to Mat and Jason to reveal intimate and authentic portraits of fulfilling marriage. Couples like the Byrds, in New Orleans, who lost nearly everything they owned in the devastation of Katrina -- except their love and commitment to each other. Or ninety-somethings Ruth and Eddie Elcott in Los Angeles, who spent the first two years of their marriage separated by World War II and the later years of their marriage reading their wartime love letters to each other at bedtime.</p><p>Along the way, Mat and Jason began to understand why their own relationships hadn't worked out quite as planned. They also realized that what they were learning from their wise new friends could change everything for them and -- through <i>Project Everlasting</i> -- show their generation and generations to come how to build a marriage to last.</p></p><p><b>Mathew Boggs</b> and <b>Jason Miller</b> have been best friends since childhood, and in 2003 they joined forces for Project Everlasting. Mat, a Scorpio and hopeless romantic, enjoys long walks on the beach. Jason, a Pisces, doesn't. When they aren't off doing speaking engagements, they're burning home-cooked meals in their Portland, Oregon, bachelor pad or on dates with Grandma Dorothy.

Why? Because only a hero as cunning and courageous and charming as Robin Hood could get a girl like Maid Marian.</p><p>Oh, Maid Marian. (I understand that she's a cartoon fox, but she's a smokin' cartoon fox.) She had a sweet, contagious laugh that made me melt. She played badminton (extra points for being athletic). My heart literally pounded when Robin Hood and Maid Marian took a midnight stroll behind a waterfall.</p><p>Robin may have had to win his archery competition against the sheriff to get a kiss, but love conquers all, right? At age ten, that's what I believed. Never for a moment did I doubt the existence of everlasting love or my ability to obtain it. Happily ever after -- isn't that what everyone wants?</p><p>Cut to several years later. I was studying for my ninth-grade biology test when my mom's voice broke the silence. Family meet- ing, she announced. This meant one of two things: Someone had either done something really right or really wrong. My family is full of overachievers, so I was more accustomed to celebrations than bad news. The second I stepped into the living room, however, I knew we wouldn't be celebrating anytime soon.</p><p>My sister sat on one end of our couch, my parents on the other. Mom was crying. She wiped away her tears and looked at me with eyes that said, <i>No matter what, you'll be okay.</i> This only worried me more. Dad, the consummate clown and entertainer, was expressionless. My parents did not touch.</p><p>My mom said, "Your dad and I have something to tell you -- we're getting a divorce."</p><p>My stomach went into zero gravity and my sister burst into tears. Several of my friends had gone through this, but their parents were completely different from mine. Their parents screamed and threw plates at one another. Divorce was a godsend to those friends, not a tragedy. My parents' split came with no warning as far as I was concerned. They'd been married twentyseven years and seemed like the happiest couple in the world. "I love you," they'd tell each other, and I believed them.</p><p>My mother's words obliterated everything I believed about love. Both my parents had betrayed me.</p><p>Lying in bed that night, my thoughts swirled so violently I became dizzy. Memories of my parents kissing and hugging, laughing, telling me over and over again, "We are soul mates, Mat," seemed like a mirage. How could this happen? How could they have lied to me?</p><p>Like most children of divorce, I was soon forced to make a decision: live out of a suitcase or pick a parent. I chose the suitcase. Every other weekend brought the bitter reminder that my home had been ripped in half. I felt turned inside out. Nothing felt familiar. The future loomed like a thick fog. What will happen to Christmas? Birthdays? Thanksgiving?</p><p>The divorce consumed all of our lives. I hated my mom for leaving my dad and I let her know it. I hated my dad for not being able to make my mom happy and I let him know it. I wanted my parents to love each other again. I wanted my family back, but it was hopeless. Apparently a commitment to forever lasted only until you changed your mind.</p><p>Thirteen years later, I was finishing my master's degree in education. My girlfriend and I were going through a nasty breakup. This relationship had lasted almost a year, a record for me.</p><p>My mom called from Portland to let me know my grandfather had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Grandpa Jack dying? It didn't seem possible. I'd loved that warm, generous man for as long as I could remember and somehow thought he'd be around forever.</p><p>"You'll be home soon," my mom said. "You need to spend some time with your grandparents, maybe arrange a date each week." Hang out with the grandparents? Of course I would. It's just that my schedule...I've got a lot on my plate...Don't get me wrong. When I was little, I idolized Grandma Dorothy and Grandpa Jack. They lived in a world of Mickey Mouse pancakes, a garden with candy hidden in it, and endless supplies of homemade cookies. They told funny stories about the olden days and thought everything I said was clever and important. They treated me like a little prince, and there was no place better than Gram and Gramps's house to find a warm hug.</p><p>My grandparents had always seemed old to me, but in a good, twinkly kind of way. In recent years, however, I'd found myself restlessly tapping my foot as I waited for them to put on their coats. They moved slowly, and I was in a perpetual hurry. I found it hard to sit through a two-hour lunch while Grandpa chewed each mouthful forty-four times and talked about the childhood friend who just died, especially when I had a ten-page term paper due.</p><p>Grandpa and Grandma were quaint and sweet and I loved them, but somewhere along the way my adoration had turned to tolerance. They listened politely but blankly when I talked about buying a laptop. And I could hardly share my girlfriend troubles with Gram and Gramps. They were the product of a bygone era. It had been, what, nearly sixty years since they had fallen in love? They probably didn't even remember what it felt like. In their day, people married for life because they didn't have a choice. Husbands worked, wives stayed home, and divorce was taboo. Even if a wife wanted out, how could she support herself? Now that couples can split up, they do -- in droves. For my grandparents' generation, it seemed to me that marriage had become a habit that just took too much effort to break. But despite the fact that we lived on two different planets, they were still my grandparents.</p><p>"Of course, I'll spend time with them," I assured my mom. "Looking forward to it."</p><p>Guilt and obligation can sap the joy out of any activity, but I did come up with what sounded like a decent plan. Each Thursday morning I'd roll up to their house for the day's excursion. Grandma would spend the prior week combing the newspaper for that week's latest and greatest lunch spot. With newspaper clippings in hand, we'd hit the road, Grandma riding shotgun and Gramps sitting in the back, with the calm of someone who has made his peace with life. We would drive two or three hours in search of special treats in out-of-the-way spots, like Mike's pumpkin milk shakes, Dooger's clam chowder, and Serendipity's rich chocolate brownie cake.</p><p>To my great surprise, I had a blast on these visits. The long drives provided ample opportunity to learn things I never knew about my grandparents. Conversations that would have normally been cut off by typical interruptions -- a phone call, an appointment, the football game -- continued on into uncharted territory. I heard the story of their first date, how Grandma's dress popped open while they were dancing and how my brave grandfather nearly lost his fingers to hopping heels as he scurried around the dance floor on hands and knees, collecting all of the buttons. Gramps told me how nervous he felt meeting Grandma's parents for the first time -- seeing their cat licking its back and hoping for a conversation starter, he commented, "I wish I could do that." But when her parents looked down, the cat was licking its crotch!</p><p>One crisp fall day, we went antiquing, Gram's favorite pastime. Dusty old furnishings and knickknacks hold zero interest for me, and it was our ninth trinket shop stop that day. I wearily pulled Gramps's Buick over and helped them out of the car. My grandparents went ahead as I locked up. I watched their slow, uneven shuffle toward the store. This was a standard sight by then, but something in that day, something in that moment, gave me pause. I noticed how their frail fingers were intertwined.</p><p>"Funny," I thought, "all these years, and they're still holding hands."</p><p>Suddenly, I stood there almost paralyzed, my eyes fixated on their hands. I know this sounds strange but the energy between them became visible. Like a movie effect, everything around them dissolved. I could see the energy of their love swirling and encircling them. It took me a second, but I got it. I remembered the longing for my true love, my Maid Marian, and my belief that our love would last forever. I hadn't had that feeling in years. I had long since abandoned the idea of everlasting love as a stupid fairy tale cartoon. Yet here it was in the flesh.</p><p>My chest began to tingle. In that moment, the couple before me became more than just my grandparents. I saw them as partners who had journeyed through a lifetime of challenge and struggle. Now at the end of their journey together, they were still crazy about each other. All these years...how had I not seen it? Grandpa beaming at Grandma, telling everyone in earshot, "Just look at her. Isn't she beautiful?" Grandma still laughing at jokes I'd heard Grandpa tell countless times. How his face lit up whenever she walked into a room! Through tear-filled eyes, I stared at the blurry image before me. How simple they made it seem! But to me it represented what I wanted most in the world. More than anything, I wanted to find the love they were living. My grandparents had been married sixty-three years, but it was not convention or habit that kept them together. Jack and Dorothy Manin were two people very much in love.</p><p>"Now, that's the marriage I want," I whispered to myself.</p><p>My grandfather passed away just a few months after that. Later, when she could talk about it, my grandma said it felt as if half of her had died with him.</p><p>After his death, I felt an overwhelming need to preserve the precious something that the two of them had shared. Hundreds of questions ran through my head: Were my grandparents an anomaly, the lone couple that just happened to remain happily married through the decades? Or could it be that other couples married forty, fifty, or sixty years were still in love, too? If so, how did they create and maintain that powerful connection? Way back when, how did they know they'd found "the One"? Didn't they worry about falling out of love one day? Or becoming bored? Was their longevity the result of dumb luck? Or cou...</p></p><h2>In The Land Of Giants</h2><p>In the Land of Giants</p><p>Max Adams is the author of Admiral Collingwood, The Prometheans, the bestselling The King in the North and In the Land of Giants.

Taken together, they give a picture of Indian life in the Eastern woodlands that provides an excellent complement to nonfiction works such as Sonia Bleeker's Indians of the Longhouse (Morrow, 1950; o.p.). The stories are well told and are enhanced by the full-page pencil drawings that precede each tale. The book fills a definite gap: there are several collections, such as Erdoes' Sound of Flutes and Other Indian Legends (Pantheon, 1976; o.p.), which deal with Plains Indians' tales, but with the exception of the author's earlier Turkey Brothers and Other Tales (Crossing Pr, 1975; o.p.), no other collection focuses on the Iroquois. This one is worth having both for entertainment and as a supplement to nonfiction for school study units on Indians.

But the Mason-Dixon Line does not&nbsp;follow anything palpable; it runs along uneven latitudes and longitudes, and at no point does it&nbsp;touch any prominent landmark. Except for its stone markers, it is invisible -- an arbitrary and man-made demarcation, direct and true, but without dimension.<br><br>Ecenbarger calls it "simultaneously, a product of reason and a national landmark."</p><p>"I had originally intended to tell the story of how the Mason-Dixon Line came to be and to walk and talk along the Line to discover what had happened in the past and what it was like now.&nbsp; But the narrower them became inescapable -- for no matter how many ways I could shuffle the deck, the race card kept coming to the top. And so I resolved to view the Line through the lens of race and learn more about this awful thing that runs so deeply in American life."William Ecenbarger has walked as much as humanly possible of the Mason-Dixon Line -- the line that defines the border of Pennsylvania and Maryland -- from its beginnings on Fenwick Island, Delaware to its end at Brown's Hill, Pennsylvania. All the while he made side trips, diverting right and left to interview the people who live along its border.<br><br>In 1780, the Pennsylvania Assembly passed a law calling for the gradual end of slavery, making the Mason-Dixon Line a lightning rod for racial conflict that continue to this day. This unique history/travelogue examines the influence of this great divider, which remains the most powerful symbol separating Yankee from Rebel, oatmeal from grits, and North from South.<br><br>Ecenbarger quotes generously from Charles Mason's journals as he describes the original journey that the two surveyors completed in 1768 -- ending eighty-seven years of dispute between the Calverts and the Penns, who, in one of history's ironies, would lose their land to the Revolution in eight years. As he walks the Line, the author also traverses history, weaving the history of the Mason-Dixon Line into the present, and describing the full relevance of its dimensions.</p><h2>The Old Man and the Sea</h2><p>He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy&#39;s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.</p><p>Here, for a change, is a fish tale that actually does honour to the author. In fact <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> revived Ernest Hemingway's career, which was foundering under the weight of such post-war stinkers as <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i>. It also led directly to his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954 (an award Hemingway gladly accepted, despite his earlier observation that "no son of a bitch that ever won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterwards"). A half century later, it's still easy to see why. This tale of an aged Cuban fisherman going head-to-head (or hand-to-fin) with a magnificent marlin encapsulates Hemingway's favourite motifs of physical and moral challenge. Yet Santiago is too old and infirm to partake of the gun-toting machismo that disfigured much of the author's later work: <blockquote> "The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords." </blockquote> Hemingway's style, too, reverts to those superb snapshots of perception that won him his initial fame: <blockquote> Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. </blockquote> If a younger Hemingway had written this novella, Santiago most likely would have towed the enormous fish back to port and posed for a triumphal photograph--just as the author delighted in doing, circa 1935. Instead his prize gets devoured by a school of sharks. Returning with little more than a skeleton, he takes to his bed and, in the very last line, cements his identification with his creator: <blockquote> "The old man was dreaming about the lions." </blockquote> Perhaps there's some allegory of art and experience floating around in there somewhere--but <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> was, in any case, the last great catch of Hemingway's career. --<i>James Marcus</i>"It is unsurpassed in Hemingway's oeuvre. Every word tells and there is not a word too many" (Anthony Burgess)<br><br>"A quite wonderful example of narrative art. The writing is as taut, and at the same time as lithe and cunningly played out, as the line on which the old man plays the fish" (<i>Guardian</i>)</p><h2>Compass of the Heart: Embodying Medicine Wheel Teachings</h2><p>Arranged in the form of a medicine wheel, <i>Compass of the Heart</i> uses the teachings of the six directions-East, South, West, North, Sky, and Earth-as it explores what it means to be consciously engaged in the life that swirls around us each and every moment. Cruden discusses daily spiritual practices-meditation, work with chakras, even teaching children or gardening-as ways of maintaining a connectedness to truth through the ups and downs of experience. These practices deepen one's relationship with the Earth so that spiritual awareness occurs not just in rare moments of inspiration but as an integral and ongoing part of life itself. More than a guide, this is the perfect companion to those following the compass of their hearts toward a union of body, earth, and spirit. <br>For those who feel a desire for a natural spirituality in their lives, <i>Compass of the Heart</i> offers insights and suggestions based on Loren Cruden's lifetime of work with Native American and other Earth-oriented traditions. <br><br>Further develops the ideas and practices set forth in the author's previous work, <i>The Spirit of Place</i>.</p><p>Loren Cruden, a midwife and herbal healer, leads shamanic workshops in the Pacific Northwest.

Four years ago, while working undercover for the CIA, she watched Diego, the father of her unborn child, perish before her very eyes -- crumbling the world around her. But one morning she awakens to find Diego lying next to her, alive and well with an unbelievable confession: he is really Rafael, Prince of Calandria, and he had been working covertly on the same mission when they met -- his death had been staged. Utterly stunned, Mia is wary and delighted -- she may have suffered a broken heart, but her breathtakingly handsome lover is back to reignite the passion that existed between them. Little does she know that Rafael has returned to give his newfound son a proper upbringing back in Calandria -- even if it means seducing Mia into marriage.

She did what any other self-actualized, self-defense-trained woman would do -- she screamed and jumped to her feet. </p><p> "Big mistake," she yelled as she backed toward the door. "You shouldn't have broken in here. I have access to weapons, and grandmothers who don't like this sort of thing. My brother's a former Navy SEAL." </p><p> The man sat up and smiled at her. "I see you still talk too much, Mia. When an unknown man appears in your bed, you should run." </p><p> He knew her name. That startled her nearly as much as the fact that he was giving her advice. It didn't seem like normal behavior for a guy intent on raping and pillaging. Assuming anyone really pillaged these days. </p><p> She paused by the door and pushed her bangs out of her face. There was something familiar about the man. The hair and eye color were all wrong, but the shape of his face reminded her of someone. And that mouth -- she would remember it until she died. </p><p> "Diego?" she breathed, knowing this stranger couldn't be him. Diego was dead. She'd seen the bullets hit his body, had watched him fall to the ground. There'd been so much blood. </p><p> "Am I that different?" the man asked as he stood and smiled at her. "Has so much changed?" </p><p> It was him, she thought, too stunned to do much more than gasp. "H-how is this possible? Why aren't you dead? I saw you die. Dead people don't have conversations." </p><p> "It is a long story. Perhaps one I could tell you over breakfast." </p><p> That voice. She would know it anywhere. It had haunted her dreams for the past five years. </p><p> Dead people also don't eat. "Get back," she said, feeling both shocked and angry. When in doubt, get pissed off. </p><p> It was a philosophy she'd learned worked for her. "I don't know what this game is, but I'm not playing it." </p><p> "Mia, it is I. You must recognize me." </p><p> "Must I?" </p><p> Right now she didn't have to do anything but keep from having a heart attack from the shock, and wish she kept a weapon in her room. Something big and scary. </p><p> The bedroom door flew open and her two grandmothers burst inside. Grandma Tessa had a fire poker in one hand, and Grammy M threatened Diego with a rolling pin. </p><p> "Call Joe," Tessa ordered Mia. "He'll take care of this scumbag." </p><p> Scumbag? Someone had been watching just a little too many police dramas. </p><p> "I'm not sure he's a scumbag," Mia said, still finding it difficult to believe her own eyes. "I might know this guy." </p><p> "You do know me," he said, his voice washing over her like a familiar and welcome memory. "Mia, it is I." </p><p> Diego? Was it possible? Conflicting emotions raced through her. She wanted to run into his arms and have him hold her forever. At the same time she wanted to grab the poker and beat him over the head with it. </p><p> "You're supposed to be dead," she said, still confused and angry, and maybe just a little scared. Because if this guy really was Diego, she was going to have a lot of explaining to do. </p><p> "So you keep saying," he told her, sounding more amused than anything else. "Would you be more happy if I were?" </p><p> "It would make more sense. I don't believe in ghosts...or vampires." </p><p> He actually smiled. "Good, because I am neither. Mia," -- he took a step toward her -- "trust your eyes and your heart. I am the man you knew as Diego." </p><p> "We don't trust people who pretend to be someone else," Grandma Tessa said with surprising force despite her small stature and advanced years. "Who do you think you are now?" </p><p> "I know I am Rafael, Crown Prince of Calandria." </p><p> Mia rolled her eyes. Great -- a crazy man in her bedroom, and she hadn't even had coffee yet. "Right, and I'm the Sleeping Beauty." </p><p> This had gone on long enough. Mia took the poker from her grandmother and held it out in front of her. "That's it. I don't know who you are or what you want, but you're in big trouble. Grammy M, call Joe." She shook the poker at the intruder. "As for you, big guy, you stay right there or I'll take you out. Don't think I can't. I've had professional training." </p><p> The man who looked amazingly like Diego had the balls to smile at her again. "I'm not going anywhere, Mia. I came to see you. I've waited five years to be with you again. I can certainly wait until you're willing to listen to reason." </p><p> Reason? "Not my strong suit. I'm more into react now, say 'Oops' later. If you're who you say you are, you should know that." </p><p> "I know many things, including the fact that you once wore a silver ring bought in a market. It was a foolish trinket, yet oddly valuable to us both." </p><p> Mia's gaze involuntarily darted to the bottom drawer of her dresser. She remembered the ring and the man who bought it for her. </p><p> He took a step closer. "I know other things," he said, his voice low and seductive. "I know how you like to be kissed and touched and where you like to -- " </p><p> "Hey," she said loudly, doing her best to both shut him up and break the spell he attempted to weave. "Grandmothers present. Let's avoid too much information." </p><p> Slowly she lowered the poker and looked at him. He was the right height and physical type. His voice was the same, as was his arrogance. His smile made her thighs go up in flames, which hadn't happened even once in the past five years. She wanted to believe because once she'd loved him so much, she'd thought knowing he was dead was going to kill her, too. </p><p> But what about the other changes? The color of his eyes, the hair, the scar? Then she remembered her brief time in a world of deception and secrecy, where people could easily be made to look different. Contact lenses, a quick dye job, and little glue -- voil�, a new man. </p><p> "I assume you have some ID on you," she said, trying to hold on to her anger, because it was safe. Only she was feeling more confused than anything else. Shouldn't she get coffee before an event like this? And maybe a cinnamon roll? </p><p> "Walk to the window," he said. </p><p> She raised the poker again and shook it at him. "You walk to the window." </p><p> He sighed. "I see you are still stubborn. Very well, Mia, we will walk together." </p><p> She eyed him warily as he moved to the window and pulled open the drapes. Keeping him at arm's-plus-poker length, she glanced down and saw a very shiny black car complete with what looked like flags flying from the front. Flags amazingly similar to the royal coat of arms of Calandria. </p><p> "So you have access to a limo, and an active imagination. That proves nothing." Actually, it kind of proved something, but she wasn't going to admit that. </p><p> He raised both hands. "As you wish. May I show you my passport?" </p><p> Her throat tightened and her mouth went dry. Man, she really wanted to brush her teeth and take a shower and get some coffee. Because after all those normal activities, none of this would be real anymore. </p><p> "Sure," she muttered. "Whatever." </p><p> But her heart began to beat faster. She didn't know if she accepted the premise that he was Diego, back from the dead, but she was halfway to being convinced. Which made no sense and gave her a stomachache. </p><p> If Diego wasn't dead, then where the hell had he been for the past five years and why hadn't he found her and told her the truth? She'd mourned him and ached for him, and what, he'd been off being some prince? </p><p> Because that's what scared her the most. That he really was Diego and Diego was in fact the prince of Calandria. The knowledge would rock her world and she didn't know how she was going to recover. Because having the child of a bad boy turned art thief was one thing, but having the child of an heir to a throne was quite another. </p><p> He pulled his passport out of his suit jacket and handed it to her. She glanced at the cover, then nodded at Grandma Tessa. "Let her read it." </p><p> Mia told herself she didn't want to look at it because she needed to keep her attention on Diego...or possibly Prince Rafael of Calandria. But in truth, she didn't want to see the words printed there. </p><p> Tessa opened the passport. Grammy M moved in close and stared over her shoulder. </p><p> "A very flattering picture," Grammy M said, smiling at him. </p><p> "Thank you." </p><p> He was all graciousness and confidence, and he didn't seem the least bit intimidated by the poker in Mia's hand, which made her want to bonk him with it. </p><p> Grandma Tessa stared at the print on the page, then looked at Mia. "It says he's the prince. Crown Prince Rafael of Calandria. <i>Prince</i> is even listed as his occupation." </p><p> Oh God. This couldn't be good. </p><p> "Of course it could be a fake," Tessa said cheerfully. "People do it all the time. A couple of hundred bucks and you have a new passport." </p><p> Definitely too much TV, Mia thought. </p><p> "A prince," Grammy M said, eyeing Rafael. "There'll be a castle, then, with the title?" </p><p> He nodded. "Of course. We're also very rich." </p><p> Grammy M beamed at Mia. "So, maybe you'll be inviting your friend the prince to breakfast?" </p><p> Mia wanted to scream. "He broke in to my <i>bedroom.</i> We don't know who he really is. The last time I saw him, he was dead, and you want to invite him to breakfast?" </p><p> Grammy M slipped her arm through Diego's...or Rafael's...and walked him to the door. "So, how will you be taking your coffee?" </p><p> Mia watched them go, then dropped the poker to the floor. "Somebody shoot me now. I know matchmaking is a time-honored Marcelli tradition, but could we please first find out the man in question isn't an ax murderer?" </p><p> Grandma Tessa handed her the passport. "You're the one who'd know that. Is he who he says he is?" </p><p> Mia stared at the picture. So much the same and yet so much different, she thought. Was it possible Diego hadn't died that night? That he was really the Crown Prince of Calandria? </p><p> "I don't know," she admitted. "I don't know anything." </p><p> Grandma Tessa moved to the door. "He was supposed to have been killed five years ago?" </p><p> Mia nodded. </p><p> "So he's Danny's father." </p><p> She nodded again. </p><p> "Then this is going to be interesting....</p></p><h2>Going Home: A Novel of the Civil War</h2><p><p>Brought to the New World from Ireland, young Joseph Forsyth is soon betrayed by his alcoholic father and separated from his beloved family.

She was a sophomore psych major. Her jellyfish wore a cape. A dialogue bubble above its head stated: I am immortal and a jellyfish.<br> <br>I hung Lucy&#x2019;s picture on the whiteboard next to Ravi&#x2019;s arctic whale, which had a horn and a side-profile smile. Ricky&#x2019;s tube worm was a bright red plume with the caption The tube worm is a vagina-like creature that can grow to be up to six feet tall. It is a deep-sea invertebrate whose only predators are accidental ones&#x2014;mainly large mammals trying to have sex with it.<br> <br>Kayla&#x2019;s drawing was not a drawing but rather a full page of double-spaced text explaining why there shouldn&#x2019;t be drawing assignments in a college creative-writing class. (Drawing animals is not creative writing any more than pottery is accounting.) She sat in the front row and glared at me. She had the posture of someone who spent her childhood balancing books on her head. She was almost certainly the treasurer of a sorority. I hung her essay next to all the animal pictures.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>My department chair, Norman, invited me to his office. Norman was a squirrelly man who always appeared to be bracing for a punch. He was from a leafy college town in the Northeast and looked out of place in Wilmington, a waterfront tourist strip that happened to have a university. He had hired me the previous summer after a string of maternity and rehab leaves of absence had left the department in need of temporary faculty who could be trusted to stay childless and sober. I wasn&#x2019;t sure why, out of the pack of graduating MFA teaching assistants, he had picked me, but maybe one of my professors had gotten the wrong idea about me and put in a good word.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, Jonas, I&#x2019;m not trying to be the administrator here,&#x201d; Norman said. &#x201c;But a student complained.&#x201d;<br> <br>This student had felt uncomfortable with last week&#x2019;s homework assignment: attend a stranger&#x2019;s funeral.<br> <br>&#x201c;Frankly,&#x201d; Norman said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if I can blame her.&#x201d;<br> <br>This student was Kayla.<br> <br>Norman waited for me to say something, but my mind was too foggy to find a good explanation.<br> <br>&#x201c;No more funerals,&#x201d; I agreed.<br> <br>Back in my office, I typed up a more traditional assignment: Write a story.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>My mind was always foggy lately. At age twenty-seven, it was my first semester sober, and without four doses of oxycodone a day, a couple tramadol in the mornings, a few methadone now and then, and a weekend bump of heroin to take the edge off, I&#x2019;d been having trouble finding my words. Sometimes when I was standing in front of the class and one of the kids asked a good question, my brain would start firing off ideas, and it was like I was alive again. I&#x2019;d explain the relationship between dialogue and narration in fiction, do an impromptu performance of how a scene from a popular movie would sound if a narrator were commenting on each piece of dialogue, and feeling my energy rising with the sound of their laughter, I&#x2019;d circle back to answer the original question by describing the moment in their assigned reading when . . . when . . . when . . . but the words would scurry into the fog again and I&#x2019;d be left um-ing and uh-ing like an idiot.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Monday morning the students slumped through the door. They&#x2019;d spent almost every Monday since they were five years old in a room like this. It took its toll&#x2014;so often being somewhere other than where you wanted to be. When I used to get high, places were interchangeable. Everywhere was the best place ever&#x2014;and then the worst. But now place mattered very much. There were few places I liked more than this classroom, with the cheap blinds over the windows, the long fluorescent light tubes overhead, and the students who, even though I often told them what to do, didn&#x2019;t seem to hate me.<br> <br>Except for Kayla. Her dislike troubled me.<br> <br>I stood at the front of the class. I was wearing jeans and a navy cardigan that had been a gift from my ex. I had been growing my hair long since a methadone nightmare the year before had given me a fear of balding. The hair now reached down past my ears. It was strong and brown and shiny and probably the best thing I had going for me.<br> <br>I held up a stack of student stories. &#x201c;This was concerning.&#x201d; I paused. &#x201c;You killed all your protagonists.&#x201d;<br> <br>The students laughed nervously. Kayla maintained eye contact from her spot in the front row.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll admit that this may be my fault. I probably shouldn&#x2019;t have sent you to the funeral. That&#x2019;s on me. I was trying something new.&#x201d; I paused. &#x201c;But here&#x2019;s the thing: Life is long and usually ends in death. Stories are short and usually don&#x2019;t. Characters can have problems without having cancer, and suicide doesn&#x2019;t always have to be the solution.&#x201d; I looked out at the students, hoping to see a reaction, which was a stupid thing to do, since, even when the students were in the middle of life-changing moments&#x2014;when they realized that all experience was subjective or that they didn&#x2019;t have to major in business administration&#x2014;they almost never visibly reacted. But today, seeing no reaction, I panicked. I took a sip of water and gathered myself. &#x201c;Please stop killing your characters. It&#x2019;s bumming me out.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>After class, I asked Kayla to stay behind for a second. I was nervous. I knew from student evaluations that one-on-one interaction was not my strong suit. In class, Professor Anderson was hilarious and super sarcastic, but in office hours he was random.<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the semester treating you, Kayla?&#x201d; I said, making casual eye contact.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s busy.&#x201d; She clutched her binder to her chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you enjoying your other classes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re an econ major, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Psychology.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Psychology: the econ of the liberal arts.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I get the feeling that you don&#x2019;t like this class.&#x201d;<br> <br>She mulled the question over. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t not like it.&#x201d; A pause. &#x201c;I had planned on liking it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You have an A, you know.&#x201d;<br> <br>She sighed. &#x201c;I feel like you&#x2019;re not teaching us what you should be teaching us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think I should be teaching you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you want to learn?&#x201d;<br> <br>She opened her mouth but stopped.<br> <br>&#x201c;It would help if you told me,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Maybe what you want to learn is what other students want to learn, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the teacher,&#x201d; she finally said.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>That evening, I went to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Technically, I should have been going to Narcotics Anonymous. But I found that the average age at AA was much higher, which meant that the sharers had better stories and that I was less likely to meet people who looked and sounded like me. After the meeting, I saw Spanish Richard waiting for me in the parking lot. Spanish Richard was a middle-aged three-hundred-pound recovering alcoholic who wore Hawaiian shirts and cargo shorts and cried every time he shared.<br> <br>&#x201c;My man,&#x201d; he said, shaking my hand and pulling me into a half hug. &#x201c;You out on the streets again?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am not. I just haven&#x2019;t been keeping up on meetings.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t tell him that I had never been &#x201c;out on the streets&#x201d;&#x2014;I had used drugs in my apartment. &#x201c;I have to get better about that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long have you been clean now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About two months.&#x201d; I refused to say, Seventy days.<br> <br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re not an expert yet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You are correct.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you started the steps?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting there.&#x201d; I had no intention of doing the steps. AA was like religion&#x2014;you could take the parts that worked for you and leave the rest.<br> <br>&#x201c;My man, at some point you have to ask yourself: How much more am I willing to lose?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;You already lost a girlfriend. How about your job? How about your home? How about your car?&#x201d;<br> <br>I used to find it strange how the men at these meetings put cars on the same level as wives, jobs, and homes on the list of things they lost to drugs and alcohol. Not until I heard a twelve-stepper describing his two hours on the bus each day as &#x201c;reflecting time&#x201d; did it occur to me how much more a car could mean to someone who&#x2019;s at the mercy of public transit and a parole officer. In the parking lot, Spanish Richard told me the story of his fall, again, and I found, again, that hearing about all-night drinking, lying, cheating, and car crashing, told with the same emphasis and pauses as the last five times, wasn&#x2019;t boring at all. Just the opposite&#x2014;it was comforting, like hearing a favorite bedtime story. Spanish Richard said that he now got more real joy from making his bed every morning than he ever did from alcohol. He talked about God as if God were a hotline I could call. He also mentioned a hotline I could call.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s twenty-four hours.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then he put his hand on my shoulder. &#x201c;You can handle it.&#x201d;<br> <br>I swallowed. &#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d;<br> <br>Spanish Richard shrugged. &#x201c;Because I can handle it.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Three weeks after our first meeting, I got another summons from the department chair. Norman didn&#x2019;t want to micromanage my process, but he was concerned.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe you want to use some course syllabi or exercises from the department file.&#x201d; Norman cleared his throat. &#x201c;Or maybe you would feel more comfortable handing over the courses to someone else.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I would love to use some course syllabi and exercises from the department file. I&#x2019;ve been struggling for direction and I think that could be just what I need. How can I access them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send you the link.&#x201d;<br> <br>I could feel that there was a but coming, so I preempted it. &#x201c;I realize that I haven&#x2019;t been on top of my game lately. There have just been a lot of changes.&#x201d; I paused. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to lose someone you care about. I didn&#x2019;t think it would affect my work so much, but it has.&#x201d;<br> <br>Norman nodded sympathetically. He didn&#x2019;t ask whom I had lost, which was lucky. The implication of sadness from losing a loved one sounded better than sadness from losing the version of yourself who got to be high all the time.<br> <br>Back in my office, still employed, I ate a multivitamin and wished it were oxycodone.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>That evening, I was walking down Front Street, passing by the bars where I used to drink, on my way to the corner store to buy an unsatisfying soda, when I ran into a group of MFA students two years behind me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jonas! Where have you been?&#x201d; they said, drunk and happy. &#x201c;We never see you anymore!&#x201d;<br> <br>They didn&#x2019;t know about the drugs or the sobriety, so there was no way to quickly explain why I could no longer be found at Lula&#x2019;s or the Blue Post, where I used to spend five or six nights a week.<br> <br>&#x201c;They kept me on for a second semester, if you can believe it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;All it took was for Daniel to realize he&#x2019;s an alcoholic.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How did he only just realize that now?&#x201d; said Stephanie. &#x201c;I realized it when he yelled &#x2018;poetry forever!&#x2019; in the middle of my first-year reading.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That wasn&#x2019;t part of the poem?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I like that poem less now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Daniel likes epiphanies,&#x201d; said Audrey. &#x201c;A character can&#x2019;t just know that he&#x2019;s an alcoholic at the beginning of the story. He has to realize it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come drink with us!&#x201d; Bobby said. &#x201c;We are drinking!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Christ, Bobby, stop yelling,&#x201d; Audrey said, and yanked him by the shirt.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a real teacher now. If they catch me at a bar, they might ship me off with Daniel.&#x201d;<br> <br>We shared hugs and they bumbled down the street toward Lula&#x2019;s. By the time they were out of sight I was shaking so badly I could barely stand.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>The next day, I biked to work, inspiring two separate pickup-truck drivers to yell their guess at my sexual orientation. In my office I found a story slid under the door. It was from Kayla. A revision. The first draft of her story had been about a young marine whose plane was shot down on his way home from Afghanistan to marry his sweetheart. In this revised version, the marine&#x2019;s plane still crashed into the sea, but this time he was resuscitated by an immortal jellyfish. The jellyfish gave up his immortality to save the marine, but there was a catch: the marine could never again leave the ocean. So the marine swam across the Atlantic to the coast of North Carolina, where he watched his lost love walking along the beach alone, day after day. Every evening, as she passed, he longed to reach out and pull her into the water. But he loved her too much, so he just floated in the waves, pining. One day he saw a man walking by her side, holding her hand. That night, the marine swam away without anger or bitterness&#x2014;only sadness that this part of his life had ended.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>On the last day of the semester, I ordered pizzas for the class. Ricky provided a &#x201c;vegan pizza,&#x201d; which was simply a loaf of sourdough bread. Lucy brought homemade cookies so perfect they looked photoshopped. We ate and laughed and played YouTube videos on the projector.<br> <br>I gave a short speech that ended with &#x201c;Now get out of here before I get emotional,&#x201d; a line that I had planned the night before, but which, as I said it in front of the class, inspired actual welling in my throat.<br> <br>On their way out, the students dropped their final assignments on my desk. Ravi shook my hand and thanked me for the class. Ricky waited for the others to leave, then looked me in the eyes and told me that this was the least boring class she&#x2019;d had in a long time.<br> <br>She closed the door after leaving; I was alone.<br> <br>I looked at the empty desks. I slammed a pizza box over my knee. I hurled it across the room. I picked up another box and raised it over my knee.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can take care of that,&#x201d; Kayla said, suddenly appearing in the doorway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh. I didn&#x2019;t see you there.&#x201d; I put the box down on the desk and made casual eye contact. &#x201c;How is the end of the semester treating you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kayla took the box from my desk, opened it, threw away the garlic-crumbed wax paper and the little plastic tripod, folded in the sides, and flattened the cardboard. She packed up the other boxes the same way, then tucked the flattened boxes under her arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just run these out to the recycling bins,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>I stood there waiting for her to return and wondering what parting words I should leave her with. It was nonsexual affection, but I didn&#x2019;t want to give her the wrong idea. I just wanted her to know that she shouldn&#x2019;t take my failure as indicative of what life would offer.<br> <br>I waited. The clock read five past. Students from the next class queued up in the hall. One peeked in to see if I&#x2019;d left yet. I glanced out the window, but of course she wasn&#x2019;t coming back.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>At home, I thought about calling my mom, a spiritual coach who was now living at a retreat in Sedona with no internet access. We had, over the years since I left home, settled into a rhythm where I called on her birthday and she called on mi...</p><h2>Otter (Animal)</h2><p><p>Although rarely seen in the wild, the otter is admired for its playful character and graceful aquatic agility, which were established in the popular imagination through books like <i>Tarka the Otter</i> and <i>Ring of Bright Water. </i>This, however, is just a very small part of their story&#x2014;throughout history the otter has also been widely hunted for its fur and flesh.&nbsp; In <i>Otter, </i>human geographer Daniel Allen reveals how the animal&#x2019;s identity has been shaped by this variety of human interactions.&nbsp; </p><p>As Allen explains, otters, while feared by some communities, were hunted to near extinction by others&#x2014;killed for their valuable pelts in the north Pacific and chased with hounds for sport in Britain. In contrast, Allen describes how Native Americans revered the otter and how indigenous fishermen in parts of Asia trained otters to assist them. Sadly, now all thirteen species of otter are considered threatened, and their survival is by no means certain. </p><p>In this wide-ranging look at the otter, Allen incorporates anecdotes from folklore,&nbsp; sports, popular literature, media, and conservation studies in order to unravel this complicated cultural history. <i>Otter </i>is<i></i>a lively book that offers a new way of thinking about this admired and endangered animal.</p></p><p><p><b>Daniel Allen</b> is a human geographer with expertise in cultural, historical, and environmental geography.</p><p>"Daniel Allen gives a captivating account of our changing relationship with the otter&#x2014;once persecuted, now adored."</p> (<i>BBC Wildlife Magazine</i>)<br><br><p>"A&nbsp;fine furry paean."</p> (<i>Guardian</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;<i>Otter</i> is the most brilliant mix of facts ancient and modern about the otter species and its vulnerability to man&#x2019;s seemingly insatiable need to hunt the poor animal for reasons other than survival.

Joe's body is found trampled into the muck behind Inez Stannert's saloon. Inez already had much more to deal with than pouring shots of Taos Lightning and cleaning up a corpse.

A science writer by day, Ann lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and is a member of Mystery Writers of America and Women Writing the West. www.annparker.net</p>Meet Inez Stannert, the poker-playing, straight-talking, gun-toting owner of the Silver Queen Saloon and the heroine of Parker's excellent debut, set in wintry Leadville, Colo., during the 1879 silver boom. Inez is married, yet her husband disappeared six months earlier with nary a trace. Her partner at the saloon, Abe Jackson, happens to be a free black man, to the dismay of much of Leadville's uptight and prejudiced populace. When a frozen corpse turns up in the mucky alley behind the saloon, Inez and Abe, still reeling from the damage caused by a barroom brawl, are shocked to learn it's their friend, precious-metals assayer Joe Rose. Joe, it seems, had a gambling problem and a nasty secret. His death puts Inez and Abe at odds with a crooked lawman, an infamous madam, a spurned suitor and the mysterious stranger who rides into town as the new minister. Drawing on historic facts and figures of 1870s Colorado, Parker tells a gripping tale of love, greed and murder in the Old West, with a cast of convincing, larger-than-life characters, including a brief appearance from Bat Masterson himself. Inez is a woman well ahead of her time and a welcome addition to the genre, as is Parker, who has left enough loose ends to beckon readers to the next Leadville mystery.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Poems of Creatures Large &amp; Small</h2><p>A collection of poems about animals features works by Lewis Carroll, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Emily Dickinson, and others</p><p></p><h2>The Sinking of the &#39;Lancastria : Britain&#39;s Greatest Maritime Disaster and Churchill&#39;s Cover-Up</h2><p>A fortnight after the evacuation at Dunkirk some 150,000 British troops were still stuck in France. As the German advance thundered west these Allied soldiers and airmen were faced with a mad dash to the coast in the hope that a troop-ship awaited them there. One such vessel was the &#39;Lancastria&#39;, a 16,000-ton liner pressed into service and now anchored off the port of St-Nazaire. On 17 June 1940, ready to head for home, the ship was bombed by the Luftwaffe. As she sank, between 3,500 and 4,000 of those on board lost their lives. Re-creating this extraordinary episode with great narrative flair, Jonathan Fenby shows us not just the human stories behind the disaster but the cover-up that followed -- as Churchill ordered a blanket ban on news stories for the sake of the country&#39;s morale. Gripping and moving, LANCASTRIA tells one of the great forgotten stories of the Second World War.</p><p>Jonathan Fenby is a former editor of the OBSERVER and of the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST. He is the author of several books including the acclaimed ON THE BRINK: THE TROUBLE WITH FRANCE and GENERALISSIMO: CHIANG KAI-SHEK AND THE CHINA HE LOST.On June 17, 1940, the <i>Lancastria</i>, a former Cunard liner turned into a troopship, sank in the harbor at St-Nazaire, France, after being hit by four bombs dropped from a German plane. On board were more than 6,000 people, mostly soldiers, although some were civilian women and children. At least 3,500 on board were killed. Eight hundred Royal Air Force men died when a bomb hit one of the holds, and another ripped through the ship's hospital. Some of the people in the water went mad. Many choked on the 1,400 tons of oil that poured out of the liner's tanks. Fenby reveals that Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered the sinking not to be reported in the press for the time being, but in the rush of events, "he forgot to lift the ban." It was the greatest loss of life in any British maritime disaster, a tragedy that Churchill tried to conceal. The book, based on accounts by survivors and other documents and diaries, is a gripping chronicle of this catastrophe. <i>George Cohen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The poems in Shaughnessy's acclaimed debut, <i>Interior with Sudden Joy</i> (1999), earned her comparisons to Sylvia Plath for their sexual frankness, tight-to-bursting compression and musical invention. Her second collection, winner of the Academy of American Poets' James Laughlin Award, brings a greater emotional bandwidth and stylistic suppleness to the task of unmasking the hoax of boundlessness in life and in love, making and making to replace the dreaming at last. The book's three sections contain nine, 11 and 10 poems, respectively, and that off-kilter triangulation&#x2014;from the terse, not-quite-tongue-in-cheek self-dismissal of the first heading, Anodyne, to the suggestion of galactic exploration and recording in the last, Astrolabe&#x2014;proves the right three-cornered lens for looking into the darkest corners of human relationships, including their embodiment: honeyed, self-twinned, fearless,/ a wineskin emptying/ into a singing stranger. Most are in the second person, who is sometimes the speaker and sometime not; most often, the addressee is a love or lover, who changes, and who is exhorted, berated, courted, rejected, fucked, accepted, lectured, soothed, teased and, always, loved: I am yours. I am still I. In its worried acceptance of contradiction, its absolute refusal of sentimentality and its acute awareness of time's scarce infinity, this is a brilliant, beautiful and essential continuation of the metaphysical verse tradition. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The&nbsp;reliance investors put on such quantitative analysis&nbsp;was catastrophic for the economy, setting off the ongoing string of financial&nbsp;crises that began with the mortgage market in 2007 and continues through today. Here Derman looks at why people-- bankers in particular --still put so much faith in these models, and why it's a terrible mistake to do so.<br><br>Though financial models imitate the style of physics and employ the language of mathematics, ultimately they deal with human beings.&nbsp;There is a fundamental difference&nbsp;between the aims and potential achievements of physics and those of finance.&nbsp;In physics, theories aim for a description of reality; in finance, at best, models can shoot only for a simplistic and very limited approximation to it. When we make a model involving human beings, we are trying to force the ugly stepsister's foot into Cinderella's pretty glass slipper.&nbsp; It doesn't fit without cutting off some of the essential parts. Physicists and economists have been too enthusiastic to acknowledge the limits of their equations in the sphere of human behavior--which of course is what economics is all about. <br><br><i>Models.Behaving.Badly</i> includes a personal account of Derman's childhood encounters with failed models--the oppressions of apartheid and the utopia of the kibbutz. He describes&nbsp;his experience as a physicist on Wall Street,&nbsp; the models quants generated, the benefits they brought and the problems, practical and ethical, they caused.&nbsp;Derman takes a close look at what a model is, and then highlights the differences between the successes of modeling in physics and its failures in economics.&nbsp; Describing the collapse of the subprime mortgage CDO market in 2007, Derman urges us to&nbsp;stop the na�ve reliance on these models, and offers suggestions for mending them.&nbsp; This is a fascinating, lyrical, and very human look behind the curtain at the intersection between mathematics and human nature.</p><p>This is an outline of the book:<br><b>Models.Behaving.Badly</b><br><br><ul><li><i><b>Part I.

What made these models, employed to minimize financial risk, so dangerous?<br><br>In this penetrating, insider's look at the recent economic collapse, Emanuel Derman--former head quant at Goldman Sachs and a former physicist--explains the collision between mathematical modeling and economics that has touched every one of us. Though financial models imitate the style of physics and employ the language of mathematics, there is a fundamental difference&nbsp;between the aims and potential achievements of physics and those of finance.&nbsp;In physics, theories aim for a description of reality; in finance, at best, models can shoot only for a simplistic and very limited approximation of reality<br>&nbsp;<br>Derman ranges widely over his first-hand experiences in practice and theory, to explain the financial tangles that have paralyzed the economy. With sharp metaphors and tremendous explanatory power,he conveys the essence of these daunting financial models--The Black Scholes Model, The Efficient Market Model, the Capital Asset Pricing Model, etc--in very human terms. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Derman clearly shows us the intrinsic deficiencies of all models and explains why Wall Street, in its love affair with them, has a blindspot that prevents it from recognizing that finance will never be physics and that it will never be possible to write down a model that encapsulates human behavior.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Emanuel Derman </b>is a professor at Columbia University, director of the university's program in financial engineering, and a principal at Prisma Capital Partners.

In this fourth and final volume in his bestselling series on Royal Navy warship development, David K Brown tackles the period in which he himself worked as a Naval Constructor. However, for this book his personal knowledge and experience is augmented by George Moore&#39;s in-depth archival research on the substantial body of material declassified in recent years. Although the fleet was enormous in 1945, much was old and worn-out, while Britain faced economic austerity and a reduced world role. At the same time new threats and novel technologies rendered even the newer ships obsolescent. How British designers responded to these unprecedented challenges is one of the central themes of the book. After considering the wartime legacy, the book moves on to cover some of the ambitious ideas for replacement or conversion of the bigger ships, most of which were stifled by lack of funds. But most of the book is devoted to new construction, with chapters on all the major categories from aircraft carriers, through destroyers and frigates, to submarines (including nuclear and strategic), minesweepers and small craft. Each contains new information on unbuilt designs, and identifies many innovations, and analyses the impact of the Falklands War. David K Brown had an eminent career as a warship designer with the Royal Corps of naval Constructors. He has published widely on historical and professional topics and his books include Warrior to Dreadnought, The Grand Fleet, and Nelson To Vanguard. George Moore devotes his time to naval research and has completed a major study of wartime naval building programmes.</p><p></p><h2>The Man Who Walked Thru Time</h2><p>Publisher: Alfred A.

This exhibition assembles 54 contemporary Korean ceramic artists whose pieces incorporate traditional techniques with new influences and innovative methods to create both functional and sculptural works. The 108 works in the exhibition date from the early 1990s through 2003, with many created especially for the tour. Despite the differences in artistic approaches, the works reveal the adventurous spirit of Korea s ceramic tradition, 5,000 years after it began.</p><p>Ms. Cho, Chung Hyun is a ceramic artist, professor and former dean in the Department of Ceramics at the College of Art and Design, Ewha Womans University in Seoul, Korea. As one of the featured artists in the exhibition, she is inspired by the naturalness of the Korean onggi method and incorporates this into her clay work. Her works are in major museums such as the National Museum of Modern Art, Seoul; Metropolitan Museum of Art, Korea; Pacific Asia Museum, Pasadena, California; Victoria and Albert Museum, United Kingdom; and the Mus�e Royal de Mariemont, Morlanwelz, Belgium.</p><h2>Montgomery County: The Second Hundred Years</h2><p>Montgomery County: The Second Hundred Years 2 Volume Set</p><p></p><h2>When Good Earls Go Bad: A Victorian Valentine&#39;s Day Novella (Dukes Behaving Badly)</h2><p><p><em>Megan Frampton's Dukes Behaving Badly series is back, though this time it's an earl who's meeting his match in a delightfully fun and sexy novella! </em></p><p>What's a lovely young woman doing asleep in his bed?

Out of print since 1987, his book The Revisionist has still been enough in some opinions to establish him as one of the most important poets of his generation; on its strength, says the Oxford Book of American Poetry, "rests a formidable underground reputation." Now, by combining The Revisionist with Crase's chapbook The Astropastorals in a new collection, Nightboat Books presents his formidable reputation to a wider public for the first time in thirty-two years.</p><p>Douglas Crase was born in 1944 in Battle Creek, Michigan, raised on a nearby farm, and educated at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton. A former speechwriter, he was described in the Times Literary Supplement as &#34;the unusual case of a contemporary poet whose most public, expansive voice is his most authentic.&#34; His work has been widely anthologized and he has received a Witter Bynner Award, Whiting Writers&#39; Award, and fellowships from the Guggenheim and MacArthur foundations for both his poetry and essays. He lives in New York and Carley Brook, PennsylvaniaPreface by Mark Ford<br><br>In his resolutely unimpressed review of Hart Crane&#x2019;s The Bridge of 1930, the critic Yvor Winters insisted that what Crane&#x2019;s poem chiefly proved was &#x2018;the impossibility of getting anywhere with the Whitmanian inspiration&#x2019;. &#x2018;No writer of comparable ability has struggled with it before,&#x2019; continued Winters, &#x2018;and, with Crane&#x2019;s wreckage in view, it seems highly unlikely that any writer of comparable genius will struggle with it again.&#x2019; Notwithstanding this harsh verdict, the centrality of The Bridge to the canon of American literature is rarely disputed these days; and Crane&#x2019;s epic has served as inspiration, rather than health warning, to generations of poets who have set out to wrestle, like Jacob with the angel, with the legacy of Whitman&#x2019;s Leaves of Grass.<br><br>In The Revisionist, published in 1981, Douglas Crase established himself as among the most resourceful, inventive, ambitious and well-equipped of those attempting to renew and extend the Whitmanian covenant. Like Crane&#x2019;s, his quest was for a historically layered epic that would acknowledge the multifarious, often grotesque, betrayals of the ideal of America as hymned by Whitman, and yet not succumb to scepticism or disenchantment. <br><br>I was a devoted John Ashbery aficionado &#x2013; indeed had signed up to write a doctoral thesis on him under the supervision of John Bayley at Oxford University &#x2013; when I acquired The Revisionist, a couple of years after it came out, in the course of one of my periodic &#x2018;research trips&#x2019; to New York, finding it on the overflowing shelves of the intoxicatingly musty Gotham Book Mart (Wise Men Fish Here) on 46th Street. At a time when post-modernist forms of irony seemed able to undermine any attempt at authentic utterance, it was a glorious experience to ride the surge of the opening lines of Crase&#x2019;s title poem, and then to realize that the emotional uplift afforded by the poem&#x2019;s rhythmic energies was the result of no trick or gimmick, but of what Emerson called a &#x2018;metre-making argument&#x2019;. <br><br>Emerson famously rubbed his eyes a little, &#x2018;to see if this sunbeam were no illusion&#x2019;, while first perusing the 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass, dispatched to him with the compliments of the author; and The Revisionist excited similar exclamations of wonder from poets and critics across the spectrum when it first appeared. Here are a few extracts from the &#x2018;chorus of smiles&#x2019; that greeted it: &#x2018;Crase has every prospect of becoming one of the strong poets of his own generation&#x2019; (Harold Bloom); &#x2018;The Revisionist seems to me an extraordinarily fine book of poems, only the more extraordinary for being a first book ... Mr. Crase is already brilliantly the master of several distinct and identifiable idioms, all of which he uses to dramatic or comic or even shocking effect&#x2019; (Anthony Hecht); &#x2018;This is the most powerful first book I have seen in a long time. The thematic title poem is magnificent, proclaiming the originality which only revision can provide, finding at a late time in parts of a twilit city the highest tales of our whole country&#x2019; (John Hollander); &#x2018;The most interesting book of first poems in many years&#x2019; (Richard Howard); &#x2018;A marvelous new poet &#x2013; deeply and absorbingly &#x201c;American&#x201d;, unfazed by the complex sentence of our past, and already parsing a future he will help us to live&#x2019; (James Merrill); &#x2018;For sheer ambition, ingenuity and wit, Crase stands alone&#x2019; (Jay Parini); &#x2018;That Crase&#x2019;s invocation of the Whitmanian poetic tradition can be so powerful after all these years of overuse and abuse is a small miracle of revisionism itself&#x2019; (Phoebe Pettingell); &#x2018;This is a staggeringly ambitious book, and its author sets about his task manfully, with no bashfulness or false modesty&#x2019; (Richard Tillinghast). It was no doubt a comment by Ashbery himself, used as jacket copy, that pushed me to spring for The Revisionist all those decades ago: &#x2018;Crase looks at the city and the landscape with the amused, disabused eye of a lover. Revisionism, in his supple argumentative poetry, turns out to be something very close to love.&#x2019;<br><br>Crase&#x2019;s title poem begins with an &#x2018;If&#x2019; &#x2013; and it must be acknowledged it&#x2019;s an awfully big one:<br><br> If I could raise rivers, I&#x2019;d raise them<br> Across the mantle of your past: old headwaters<br> Stolen, oxbows high and dry while new ones form,<br> A sediment of history rearranged.<br><br>Nevertheless, despite the hypothetical manner in which it is framed, the task the poem here sets itself is &#x2013; imaginatively at least &#x2013; a Herculean one, for its goal is a recasting of the idea of America that will change both understanding of the country&#x2019;s historical record and the prevailing sense of possibilities available to the contemporary &#x2018;American Scholar&#x2019;, to borrow another concept from Emerson. The suppleness, to use Ashbery&#x2019;s term, of the argument depends not so much on developing a logical sequence of cause and effect, as in dramatizing, in an original and highly charged idiom, the on-going processes of engagement and participation, the ebb and flow of belonging inherent in the idea of democracy &#x2013;or at least in Whitman&#x2019;s figurations of democracy. <br><br>At the same time Crase is ever-conscious that it takes all sorts to make up a demos, and that poetry can no more escape the uses of language that surround it, the uses, indeed, that it models and mimics and shadows, and on which it depends, than an American citizen can escape the implications of E pluribus unum. In a fascinating comment on his prosody of 1987 Crase outlined his concept of &#x2018;civil meter&#x2019;, which he defined as &#x2018;the meter we hear in the propositions offered by businessmen, politicians, engineers, and all our other alleged or real professionals&#x2019;: <br><br> If you write in this civil meter, it&#x2019;s true you have to give up the Newtonian certainties of the iamb. But you gain a stronger metaphor for conviction by deploying the recognizable, if variable patterns of the language of American power. And to say that this civil meter is a metaphor for conviction is to acknowledge that it, just like iambic measures, is a unit of artifice and one dimension of a form.<br><br>The authority admiringly noted by so many early reviewers of The Revisionist has, therefore, to be insistently monitored and assessed, along with the forms of complicity that it entails with the &#x2018;language of American power&#x2019;. Much of the excitement of Crase&#x2019;s poetry can be traced to the self-conscious interplay that it generates between the heady impetus of its rhythmic drive &#x2013; that is its meter &#x2013; and the civil awareness of &#x2018;artifice&#x2019; that it simultaneously inculcates. Not for nothing did Crase study as an undergraduate in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton (1962-66); and clearly his day job as a speech-writer for clients ranging from Eastman Kodak to General Electric has fostered in him a preternatural sensitivity to the implications and cadences of public discourse.<br><br>Only rarely, however, in a poem such as &#x2018;Experience and What to Make of It&#x2019;, with its italicized academic markers (Abstract ... Statement of the problem ... Materials and methods ... Results ... Discussion ...etc.) does Crase approach the realms of satire. His primary mode in The Revisionist is a sinuous, semi-abstract landscape poetry that combines topographic and historic and political perspectives that react with each other like chemicals in an on-going experiment; in its volatile instability, Crase&#x2019;s composite medium, held together only, it often seems, by his masterful syntax, is mimetic of his impatience with clich�s, his restless search for new ways of conjugating our attempts to inhabit the past and the present, or to envisage the future. At moments the Whitmanian promise (&#x2018;I stop somewhere waiting for you&#x2019;) is converted into the language of office-speak &#x2013; &#x2018;In every jurisdiction / And every area I promise I&#x2019;ve already arrived&#x2019;. Elsewhere, following the Crane of &#x2018;Repose of Rivers&#x2019; or the Ashbery of &#x2018;Pyrography&#x2019; (written in 1976 for America&#x2019;s bicentennial celebrations), Crase is drawn to dreamy, bird&#x2019;s-eye views of land and nation, as in the whimsical &#x2018;The Continent as the Letter M&#x2019;, with its nod and a wink to Wallace Stevens&#x2019;s &#x2018;The Comedian as the Letter C&#x2019;:<br><br> To the soft soil of that consonant we return<br> Made Massey-Ferguson fertile and turning over<br> A train of little m&#x2019;s behind the plow. America ...<br><br>America may be the grandest of ideas, as well as a physical country, but can&#x2019;t it also be eyed on the most granular level, in relation to the shape of its second letter, a letter that also happens to be the first in the name of a major manufacturer of agricultural equipment, whose ploughs, in another rhyme, make m-shaped furrows in the land? Yet M is also, the poem then points out, prominent in the names of three of the Native American peoples who fell victim to its European invaders &#x2013; Maumee, Menominee, Michilimackinaw. As in the &#x2018;Powhatan&#x2019;s Daughter&#x2019; section of The Bridge, poetic stirring of the sediment of history may expand awareness and knowledge, but it can also induce guilt and vertigo &#x2013; &#x2018;Deep, past Appalachian deep,&#x2019; Crase&#x2019;s poem concludes, &#x2018;The inarticulate lives in its hold on me.&#x2019;<br><br>The Revisionist&#x2019;s exploration of the concept of revision is sophisticated, wide-ranging and astute. It enables Crase to position his idiom in relation to his Transcendentalist forebears, indeed to create his own late-twentieth-century version of Emersonian rhetoric, in which urgings and images whirl dizzyingly forward, while the logic supposedly undergirding their propulsive movement keeps raising then ducking its head. &#x2018;Power,&#x2019; as &#x2018;Self-Reliance&#x2019; proclaims, &#x2018;ceases in the instant of repose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim.&#x2019; Crase&#x2019;s syntax is the primary bearer of this display of self-reliant power, &#x2018;shooting&#x2019;, as it does, &#x2018;the gulf&#x2019; between competing idioms and ideas, and insisting &#x2013; or at least delicately insinuating &#x2013; that both the writer and the reader (at least once she or he has &#x2018;tuned in&#x2019;), can be energised and boosted by the multiple transitions that the poem traces. Consider the time and space covered by this sentence, and the vision of contingency and of historical process that it parses:<br><br> It&#x2019;s inescapable <br> How history has targeted the tiniest, safest life<br> With the knowledge that chance and power, unmitigated, <br> Are always impending out of the godless distance toward it<br> The way there is always a comet impending toward the earth<br> And it&#x2019;s only a question now of how close and when,<br> A recombinant message which has breached the world<br> And altered the code so thoroughly that issues graceful once<br> As travel or turning the calendar beget features of flight,<br> Contortion and alarm instead.<br> <br> (&#x2018;There Is No Real Peace in the World&#x2019;)<br><br>The phrase &#x2018;godless distance&#x2019; is itself a measure of the temporal and cultural gulf between Crase and such as Emerson and Whitman and Thoreau, and hence of the need for a revisionist capable of extrapolating from their belief-systems what can still be of use when transplanted to the disembodying networks and information streams of secular late-capitalism.<br><br>The Revisionist, which came out when Crase was 37, ran to 83 pages in the original edition. Those not familiar with the contours of his career may be surprised to see that it occupies around 5/6ths of this Collected Poems. What, such readers are likely to wonder, has Crase been up to in the decades since? Well, in 1996 he published a commonplace book entitled Amerifil.txt that collaged extracts from twenty-three writers, ranging in dates from John Wise (1652-1725) to John Ashbery (1927-2017); these passages were chosen for the light they cast, directly or obliquely, on &#x2018;the nature of the national character&#x2019;, as the book&#x2019;s subtitle put it. Eight years later appeared Both, a highly original double-portrait of a pair of Harrow-educated English botanists called Rupert Barneby (1911-2000) and Dwight Ripley (1908-1973) &#x2013; Ripley was also a poet, an artist, and a patron of institutions such as the gallery Tibor de Nagy. And in 2017 Pressed Wafer issued two Crase volumes: a collection of Essays and Addresses called Lines from London Terrace (London Terrace being the vast block on West 23rd Street in which Crase has an apartment), and The Astropastorals, a chapbook containing 13 new poems. It is this chapbook that is here reprinted as the final 1/6th of Crase&#x2019;s poetic oeuvre. An acknowledgements note included in the Pressed Wafer edition (which sports on its cover a glorious portrait of Crase by Trevor Winkfield) revealed that the earliest of these new poems, &#x2018;Once the Sole Province&#x2019;, appeared in 1979, and the last, &#x2018;Astropastoral&#x2019;, in 2000.<br><br>The idea of an &#x2018;astropastoral&#x2019; is a curious one, and on inspection becomes, as Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s Alice famously put it, &#x2018;curiouser and curiouser&#x2019;. Crase&#x2019;s post-The Revisionist poems set about applying his &#x2018;civil meter&#x2019; to the cosmos itself, partly, one suspects, in search of some kind of escape from the corporate hegemony that has so ruthlessly determined the horizons of American citizens in the years since Ronald Reagan came to power (the year before The Revisionist was published), but also as a means of articulating a global eco-consciousness. Seen from afar, the whole earth can seem a mixture of dump and refuge, as the chapbook&#x2019;s last lines make clear, the civil space between them increasingly imperilled:<br><br> and the study a species<br> Must turn to is that earth<br> Where the dump and the refuge are relations under the sun.<br><br>Planet, sun, firmament, stars, space, heaven, the &#x2018;sky&#x2019;s brightest body&#x2019;, predominate in the semantic field of the title poem, &#x2018;Astropastoral&#x2019;, although I am not sure, despite its evocation of these interstellar perspectives, if it isn&#x2019;t also a coded love poem addressed to a charismatic but elusive hero-figure somewhat in the mould of The Leader in W.H. Auden&#x2019;s The Orators:<br><br> Saw you vote with your feet and hit the ground running,<br> Kiss the ground, rescued, and (this wasn&#x2019;t a drill)<br> Saw you fall to your knees on the ground<br> By the body of your friend on the ground<br> And though these fall beside you like gantries, it is<br> You who are rising above them and you are not there.<br> Like a rocket in winter, I have been there to see you<br> Logged in as a guest among stars ...<br><br>Counterbalancing the galactic vistas opened up by the poems collected in The Astropastorals are less uplifting references to pollution (&#x2018;Dog Star Sale&#x2019;), ammo dumps (&#x2018;Theme Park&#x2019;), pipelines, landfill and wasteland (&#x2018;Refuge&#x2019;). Those familiar with The Revisionist but reading these later poems here for the first time will note on occasion a certain loosening in the tightly-woven mesh of Crase&#x2019;s poetic idiom &#x2013; four commas and a colon make up all the punctuation deployed in &#x2018;Dog Star Sale&#x2019;, for instance, while three of the book&#x2019;s shortest poems come to us with no title, as if they were odd fragments of poetic material snipped and stored for future use. <br><br>It is to be hoped that the poems in The Astropastorals will be seen as more than just a coda to the achievement of The Revisionist. They reveal Crase swivelling his wide-angled telescope from the earth to the heavens, and reporting back eloquently on the infinite spaces that so terrified Pascal. &#x2018;Up slip creek in the dark&#x2019; is how, in a quirky moment of humour, one of these poems sums up Crase&#x2019;s confrontation with the sublime &#x2013; a region, unlike America, which no amount of revision can ever make habitable.</p><h2>The Fairy Caravan</h2><p>A facsimile of the original Beatrix Potter story of a miniature circus.</p><p>Beatrix Potter (1866-1943)</p><h2>Big George: How a Shy Boy Became President Washington</h2><p>A boy from Virginia becomes the first president<br><br> Before he was the face on the dollar bill, George Washington was a shy boy with a hot temper.

Professor Wehler became one of the most prominent exponents of this approach and his structural analysis of the 'Kaiserreich' created a considerable stir when it was first published.

Although Hannah misses her older brother, Ben, who is off fighting the British, there is no time to brood. First the lively ten-year-old joins in the spring-cleaning, then it's time to pluck the geese, shear the sheep, spin the wool into yarn, make dye, and finally color skein after skein until ``Hannah felt as if she were sitting in the middle of a rainbow.'' While Hannah works, she marvels at what she sees as the seat of her mother's competence, her hands. ``They were so small, yet they could do so many things. . . . They spun and wove and sewed. They scrubbed and dug in the garden. . . . Strong hands. Gentle hands. . . . Helping hands.''

The story ends with a robust climax based on a true historic incidentthe razing of Fairfield, Connecticut, by British soldiers. It's a fiery, realistic finish, but it will be the day-to-day details and how-to of colonial life that will keep readers intrigued.

Curtis</h2><p>It is thus near to Nature that much of the life of the Indian still is; hence its story, rather than being replete with statistics of commercial conquests, is a record of the Indian's relations with and his dependence on the phenomena of the universe--the trees and shrubs, the sun and stars, the lightning and rain--for these to him are animate creatures. Even more than that, they are deified, therefore are revered and propitiated, since upon them man must depend for his well being.<br>--Edward S. Curtis, <i>The North American Indians</i><br>Between 1896 and 1930, Edward S. Curtis documented Native Americans and their way of life in the western United States and British Columbia.

She began to write and design her own picture books when she had a young family and has now published more than two hundred titles. Shirley&#39;s first novel, Hero on a Bicycle (9781406336115) was published by Walker in 2012. She lives in West London.PreSchool-Grade 1 A rosy, fat-cheeked little girl narrates 18 simple poems about the weather and the seasons, describing experiences with mud, blossoms, water, and sand with rhythmic simplicity. While the poems are pleasant and evoke the images a child might have of weather and seasons, it is Hughes' realistic pictures which make this book. Readers not only come to know the seasons through natural data but also come to know the small narrator's family and her world. Children will enjoy watching for the narrator's baby brother, her parents, her cat and dog, and her special toys in the half-page watercolor paintings and the small detailed pictures which surround the text. Seasonal poems are clumped together and set off by a double-page spread which highlights people and their activities in each season. The busy spring pictures, full of people gardening, cleaning, and hanging out of windows to talk and enjoy the weather, evoke the sense of freedom of that season after a long winter. While the poems would work well in preschool story hour sessions on seasons, the detailed pictures cry out for a lap or occasions in which one or several children sit down and pore over the book.

He&#x2019;s 5&#x2019;6&#x201d; and weighs 130 pounds. Although on the cusp of thirty, he could easily pass for a scrawny teenager. <br><br>One day Michael, a guy with a patchwork employment record and dreams as big as his ego, meets Harvey and begins to relay all these wild stories about his life. Simple as that. Harvey thinks the guy is bright but a bit of a riddle&#x2013;though not the kind wrapped in an enigma. It&#x2019;s strange. He seems like the type of person you meet every day, rather ordinary, until you really get to know him. Then you realize he&#x2019;s exceptional, unusual, and contradictory. Pleasant one minute, really nasty the next. But isn&#x2019;t cruelty part of human nature? We digress. . . .<br><br>Harvey writes up and illustrates one of Michael Malice&#x2019;s tales, &#x201c;Fish Story,&#x201d; which is part of American Splendor: Our Movie Year. It makes a splash and spawns this book, Harvey&#x2019;s first hardcover, a graphic novel event about one guy&#x2019;s life.<br><br>Ego &amp; Hubris relates how, a year and a half after his birth in the Ukraine, Michael Malice moved with his parents to Brooklyn. He&#x2019;s an intransigent kid, a hard-ass&#x2013;both a demon to and demonized by the people who cross his path. His life is a constant struggle for validation in a world where the machine keeps trying to break him down. But Michael has a way with people . . . or rather, has a way of getting even with people. Hey, if you can&#x2019;t live up to your parents&#x2019; expectations, at least you can live up to your name. <br><br>Michael had never come close to fulfilling his huge dreams&#x2013;until now. And just as Harvey&#x2019;s been the everyman for a certain generation of graphic-novel readers, Michael Malice will be the everyman for a new generation.</p><p>Harvey Pekar, a native of Cleveland, is best known for his autobiographical slice-of-life comic book series American Splendor, a first-person account of his downtrodden life, which was made into a movie starring Paul Giamatti. He is also the author of Best of American Splendor and American Splendor: Our Movie Year. He is an omnivorous reader, and obsessive-compulsive collector, and a jazz critic whose reviews have been published in The Boston Herald, The Austin Chronicle, and Jazz Times. He has done freelance work for the critically acclaimed radio station WKSU and has appeared eight times on Late Night with David Letterman and two times on The Late Show with David Letterman.A<i>merican Splendor</i>'s Pekar branches out into a full-length story of someone else. This first-person tale documents the life of New York native Michael Malice, a fairly streetwise geek of frightening intelligence, if he does say so himself. Which he does. Numerous times. Malice's autobiography consists of a long string of episodes where he is right and everyone else is wrong. From first grade&#x2014;where a teacher forces him to mispronounce a word in a children's story&#x2014;to his string of nowhere temp jobs, he's in constant contact with people who are far stupider than he. The story gets much of its power from the shock value inherent in the narrator's unshakable confidence in himself. Dumping a girlfriend with leukemia, beating up on his intellectual inferiors, heaping contempt on those he doesn't agree with, Malice has endless energy for pointing out the faults in others. Still, Pekar makes him a compelling and memorable character, with his endless hunger for something better. Malice is clever and, at moments, surprisingly sympathetic&#x2014;chiefly when he contradicts his own stated principles and derives intense satisfaction from the approval of others. Dumm, longtime Pekar collaborator, illustrates in his usual straightforward, quotidian style. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The only overt signs of domestication in the benign landscape they inhabit is the stone platform - too orderly to be natural but having no obvious present use to justify the effort of its construction - and the dog. No bathing houses or other reminders of a resort establishment, no pile of discarded shoes or stiff collars intrudes to suggest another existence, of labor or a wider society, to which they must ultimately return.

Author Robert N Clements, who served in the battalion throughout that period and rose from private to captain, wrote the story many years after the war, based on his personal memories and experiences. As such, his story reflects two unique perspectives on Canadian military history &#x2013; the remarkably fresh recollections and anecdotes of a veteran, and the outlook of a man eager to share what his generation contributed to the nation&#x2019;s history, character, and identity.</p><p>Professional military historian Brian Douglas Tennyson buttresses Clements&#x2019;s story with a valuable critical apparatus, including an analytical introduction that contextualizes the history and notes that explain unfamiliar points and people. <em>Merry Hell</em> is a captivating tale for those who enjoy stories of war and battle, and one that will entertain readers with Clements&#x2019;s richly colourful anecdotes and witty poems, none of which have been published before.</p></p><p><strong>Brian Douglas Tennyson</strong> is emeritus professor in the Department of History at Cape Breton University. <p></p><p>&#x2018;Merry Hell is a well written book that can be used for casual reading or academic study...

University of Maryland professor Harrison examines the subjects and texts of their songs, the toll these performers paid for their right to be heard, and what they did to transform a folk tradition into a popular art. She describes the singing and lifestyles of Sippie Wallace, Victoria Spivey, Edith Wilson and Alberta Hunter to illustrate how they introduced a new model of the black woman: assertive and sexy, gutsy yet tender, bereft but not downtrodden, exploited but not resentful, independent yet vulnerable. The author shows that their choice of performing style, inflection, emphasis and improvisation provided a perspective and expressiveness that profoundly affected later American popular music.</p><p>Blues music spawned legendary performers whose influence has been felt in many musical forms here and around the world. Until now the important role of the great women blues singers has largely gone unexplored. This book tells of the cultural and social impact of the blues during the 1920s when the genre was dominated by women, both on stage and on record. Harrison (Afro-American Studies Department, University of Maryland) writes with authority, focusing particularly on Sippie Wallace, Edith Wilson, Victoria Spivey, and Alberta Hunter as she analyzes the music and the collective black experience out of which it grew. A significant book, particularly for collections of music history, black studies, and women's studies. Daniel J.

Over more than thirty years, he has produced a vibrant and compelling body of work that is widely collected and internationally exhibited. His familiar signature style of lines or bands of color, alluding to architectural elements such as portals, windows, and walls, is one of the most instantly recognizable in contemporary painting. This book is the first fully illustrated monograph to present an account of the artist's entire life and career to date, from his childhood in 1950s London, via New York and Barcelona, to the present day in Munich. Lavish, full-page reproductions of all his major works illustrate the text, while photographs taken by Scully on his travels show some of the forms that inspire them. Photographs of Scully at work in his studio demonstrate stage-by-stage how he creates his pictures, from blank canvas to finished work. Eminent art historian and critic David Carrier traces the development of Scully's oeuvre and assesses its significance. Drawing on his many conversations with Scully, Carrier provides unique insights into the artist's working methods and the motivations for his art. Extracts from Scully's own passionate writings and lectures on painting complete a volume that should be found on all contemporary art bookshelves. 214 illustrations, 205 in color.</p><p>David Carrier is Champney Family Professor, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland Institute of Art.Text: Italian, English</p><h2>Street Level</h2><p>Winner of the 1999 St. Martin's Press/ PWA Award for Best First Private Eye Novel<br><br>When we meet private detective Duncan Sloan he's just handed back a five thousand-dollar check meant as advance payment on a job. The wealthy prospective client wants Sloan to find a woman with an eyeball tattooed on her bottom. All he knows is the tattoo, that she's very young, white and probably somewhere in or near Orlando, Florida, Sloan's hometown. Thanks but no thanks; that's not enough. But when the five grand reappears in Sloan's mailbox, he uses it for a Costa Rican vacation and never mind the job.<br><br>Pike, however tracks him down. When he explains the assignment, Sloan finds it bizarre enough to say "yes." Isaac Pike is the only son of a top-ranked tycoon. He is also gay. Because he genuinely wants to be a father, he has deposited sperm with a reputable clinic while he searches for a suitable mother. But a paroled convict working at the clinic steals the sperm, impregnates a teenager with it, and blackmails Pike - send money or we abort the child.<br><br>Although Pike's idea of a suitable mother is not quite a waif from an Orlando trailer park, he is decent enough to be genuinely concerned about both mother and child.<br><br>Sloan pursues the thief and his buddies and, he hopes, the girl, through the Florida city's sad neighborhoods and outlying cheap motels, calling on his drug-enhanced informers and a contact in the police. Getting closer brings him to the mangled bodies of the young mother-to-be's relatives, and closer to his own danger as well. On he goes -- Duncan Sloan may be a reluctant detective, but when he's wound up he's hard to stop.<br><br><i>Street Level</i> is Bob Truluck's first novel. It was chosen as the Best First Private Eye Novel of 1999 in the contest sponsored by Private Eye Writers of America and St. Martin's Press. <br></p><p>Florida PI Duncan Sloan is a lot less laid-back than the jacket copy on this sassy, smart-talking thriller would have you believe. His style may be casual, but his detecting skills are up to the job of tracking the lowlifes who stole the sperm of a gay millionaire from a fertility clinic and put it into a trailer-park babe who's dreaming of a big score when the baby is born. <p> Author Bob Truluck, winner of the 1999 St. Martin's Press/PWA award for best first private eye novel, is a worthy addition to the ranks of thriller writers who cover the same scene. His sense of humor isn't quite as warped as Carl Hiaasen's and his characters aren't quite as bizarre as Laurence Shames's, but he works the territory well enough for the reader to feel the heat and hear the bugs in the palmetto trees. And Sloan, the womanizing dick with the sentimental soft side, is an interesting enough guy who may grow into a popular recurring hero. Truluck has a deft hand with his secondary characters, particularly Ike Pike, the aforementioned millionaire, whose dreams of fatherhood are barely affected by the criminal tendencies of the woman carrying his baby, and Steven Glass, Ike's partner, who's less than thrilled about his lover's desire for a child. All the noirish details are in place, and Sloan's knight-errant antecedents reach back almost as far as beloved private eye Travis McGee. A nice addition to the genre, <i>Street Level</i> has the feel of a first-in-a-series outing, with more of Sloan's adventures already in the offing. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Bob Truluck lives in Orlando, Florida and is a building contractor when he's not busy writing mysteries.<br></p><h2>No Second Chance</h2><p>Dr. Marc Seidman is living in a suburb of New Jersey with his new wife, Monica, and their baby daughter, Tara, when the shocking attack occurs. Marc is left barely clinging to life. When he wakes up at the hospital, he learns that Monica is dead -- and that Tara is missing from her crib. For two weeks there is no word. Then a ransom demand is made for Tara's return. But Marc makes a mistake. Something goes terribly wrong during the money drop. The ransom money vanishes. The kidnappers get away. Crushed, Marc waits by the phone for another call. Days turn to weeks as Marc remembers the ransom note's ominous warning: THERE WILL BE NO SECOND CHANCE. <p>An agonizing eighteen months passes with no word and no new clues. And then, when Marc has just about given up all hope of seeing his daughter again, he gets a package with a chilling note attached: WANT A SECOND CHANCE? And inside the package the kidnapper provides proof that Tara is still alive...</p></p><p>Harlan Coben was the first ever author to win all three major crime awards in the US, and has established a best-selling series of crime novels starring his powerful creation, Myron Bolitar. He currently lives in New Jersey with his wife and three children.NO SECOND CHANCE demonstrates that Harlan Coben is one of the finest contemporary suspense writers and that Scott Brick is among the elite audiobook narrators. When their skills are combined, the result is almost magical. Coben's story has plot twists aplenty, almost too many, and Brick's reading adds an intensity that propels the story at a breakneck pace. Coben wrote NO SECOND CHANCE in the first and third person, which makes this a particularly challenging novel to read. Brick not only meets the challenge, he triumphs over it, providing every character with a unique voice and personality, as well as an individual tone and pace. Coben has developed a loyal following, as should Brick. D.J.S.

In this book he considers the spiritual questions asked by veterans he counseled, the principal one being, "Where was God in Vietnam?" In refreshingly nonsermonizing fashion, he discusses the God of myth and the God of scripture, and goes on to make distinctions between what he believes are divinely generated events and those God allows to happen. The author is critical of what he calls the mythology of American civil religionunder the cover of which, he argues, our troops were sent into dubious battleand about the failure of the military chaplaincy in Vietnam as well as the failure of the organized church to help vets adjust to civilian life. For all that, Mahedy is decidedly upbeat, eloquent in the encouragement he holds out to veterans who are still having spiritual difficulties. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.This book attempts to describe how the Vietnam War affected the religious beliefs of those who fought in it and to draw religious lessons from their experience. It is not really a comprehensive account but rather a selective report based primarily on the author's intense postwar involvement with those troubled veterans who have come to the "Vet Centers" that the author helped found in 1979. Read as one former army chaplain's reflection on the war, as described by these veterans, the book contains some appropriate religious conclusions along with some over-heated rhetoric. The author's concluding sermonic call for American repentance and healing follows naturally while adding to the work's rather high ratio of exhortation to information and analysis.

He is a young tabby cat with four white paws, and he lives happily with a young married couple, Marilyn and Bill Bricker. The center of the Bricker household, Socks rules it affectionately but firmly.</p><p>Into this loving home, however, comes another pet. This creature has a small, wrinkled, furless face, and Mr. and Mrs. Bricker spend an inordinate amount of time trying to burp it. Its arrival fills Socks with jealousy and a terrible anxiety. How the rivalry between Socks and Charles William, the Bricker baby, turns into an alliance makes a domestic drama both touching and funny.</p><p>Although her story is about a cat and faithful to his point of view in every detail, Mrs. Cleary demonstrates with it the emotional upheaval experienced by a child who must learn to share his parents. As young readers come to understand Socks and his problems, they will gain a new understanding of themselves. But, most of all, they will laugh.</p></p><p><p>Watch out, socks!</p><p>Socks is one happy cat. He lives the good life with his affectionate owners, Mr. and Mrs. Bricker. Ever since the day they saved him from a life spent in a mailbox drop slot, Socks has been the center of their world. And he always has everything he needs&#x2014;tasty kitty treats and all the lap room he could want!</p><p>But when a new baby arrives, suddenly the Brickers have less and less time for Socks. Little Charles William is the one getting all the attention. Socks feels left out&#x2014;and to show it, he starts getting into all sorts of trouble! What will it take to make Socks realize just how much the Brickers care about him?</p>Beverly Cleary was born in McMinnville, Oregon, and, until she was old enough to attend school, lived on a farm in Yamhill, a town so small it had no library. Her mother arranged with the State Library to have books sent to Yamhill and acted as librarian in a lodge room upstairs over a bank. There Mrs. Cleary learned to love books. When the family moved to Portland, where Mrs. Cleary attended grammar school and high school, she soon found herself in the low reading circle, an experience that has given her sympathy for the problems of struggling readers. By the third grade she had conquered reading and spent much of her childhood either with books or on her way to and from the public library. Before long her school librarian was suggesting that she should write for boys and girls when she grew up. The idea appealed to her, and she decided that someday she would write the books she longed to read but was unable to find on the library shelves, funny stories about her neighborhood and the sort of children she knew. <p>After graduation from junior college in Ontario, California, and the University of California at Berkeley, Mrs. Cleary entered the School of Librarianship at the University of Washington, Seattle. There she specialized in library work with children. She was Children's Librarian in Yakima, Washington, until she married Clarence Cleary and moved to California. The Clearys are the parents of twins, now grown. Mrs. Cleary's hobbies are travel and needlework. </p><p>Mrs. Cleary's books have earned her many prestigious awards, including the 1984 John Newbery Medal for <i>Dear Mr. Henshaw,</i> for the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children in 1983. Her <i>Ramona and Her Father</i> and <i>Ramona Quimby, Age 8</i> were named 1978 and 1982 Newbery Honor Books, respectively. Among Mrs. Cleary's other awards are the American Library Association's 1975 Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, the Catholic Library Association's 1980 Regina Medal, and the University of Southern Mississippi's 1982 Silver Medallion, all presented in recognition of her lasting contribution to children's literature. In addition, Mrs. Cleary was the 1984 United States author nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Award, a prestigious international award. Equally important are the more than 35 statewide awards Mrs. Cleary's books have received based on the direct votes of her young readers. The Beverly Cleary Sculpture Garden for Children, featuring bronze statues of Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, and Ribsy, was recently opened in Portland, Oregon. </p><p>This witty and warm author is truly an international favorite. Mrs. Cleary's books appear in over twenty countries in fourteen languages and her characters, including Henry Huggins, Ellen Tebbits, Otis Spofford, and Beezus and Ramona Quimby, as well as Ribsy, Socks, and Ralph S. Mouse, have delighted children for generations. There have been Japanese, Spanish, and Swedish television programs based on the Henry Huggins series. PBS-TV aired a ten-part series based on the Ramona stories. One-hour adaptations of the three Ralph S. Mouse books have been shown on ABC-TV. All of Mrs. Cleary's adaptations still can be seen on cable television, and the Ramona adaptations are available in video stores.</p><p></p></p><h2>Southern Smoke: Barbecue, Traditions, and Treasured Recipes Reimagined for Today</h2><p><b>Informed by the history of classic southern recipes,&nbsp;<i>Southern Smoke&nbsp;</i>is an intriguing dive into the barbecue of North Carolina, the Lowcountry, Memphis, and the Delta, with must-try meats, sides, and desserts.</b><br><br> For years, Matthew Register, the owner and pitmaster of Southern Smoke Barbecue, has been obsessed with the<b>&nbsp;history of southern recipes</b>.

These actors' identities have continually eluded most moviegoers. But their unforgettable faces and personalities are another story. Included are exhaustive interviews with: - R. G. Armstrong- Burly, prolific western star-- A perennial movie sheriff, Sam Peckinpah regular, and, unrecognizably, Dick Tracy's arch-nemesis, Pruneface! - Dick Bakalyan- The pugnacious Crown Prince of the Juvenile Delinquent film, familiar Disney movie player, and co-star of films as disparate as Ray Milland's Panic in Year Zero! and Roman Polanski's Chinatown. - Don Pedro Colley- Imposing, regal co-star of Beneath the Planet of the Apes (as the telepathic mutant inquisitor), THX-1138 (as a hologram), and Sugar Hill (as Baron Samedi, king of the zombies). - Royal Dano- In his last interview, Dano recalls his extensive career, working with Alfred Hitchcock, John Huston, Nicholas Ray, Jack Arnold, and dozens of other Hollywood notables. - Jonathan Haze- As part of director Roger Corman's stock company, Haze achieved cinematic immortality as the luckless "Seymour" in Corman's original The Little Shop of Horrors. Besides his multifarious work with Corman, Haze wrote AIP's manic Invasion of the Star Creatures, and worked behind the cameras with the likes of John Wayne. - Bo Hopkins- A cinematic stalwart of the '70s, whose credits include The Wild Bunch (his debut), The Getaway, Monte Walsh, American Graffiti, and The Day of the Locust. Another perennial movie sheriff! - L. Q. Jones- A western, war, and Peckinpah film staple, and director of the cult science fiction classic, A Boy and His Dog.

Breath is more than a metaphor of the fluid continuum of personal and transpersonal energy. According to the Grofs, breath acts as a conduit for the energy, sustaining the mind as well as the body. In ordinary "hylotropic" consciousness, one is aware of only a limited portion of the vast spectrum of energies being exchanged. The technique of Holotropic Breathwork is designed to accelerate breathing and at the same time greatly expand awareness of the transcendent forces pervading each moment of human life. Faster and deeper breathing and music are used to bring about a trance state comparable to the state reached in Sufi dancing or Native American sweat-lodge rituals. The Grofs maintain that in this state it is possible to get access to kinds of consciousness experiences: sensory, biographical, perinatal (centered around the time of birth), and transpersonal. </p><p>Kendo </p><p>The goal of kendo is to overcome the opponent by overcoming the self. This involves tremendous self-discipline and intense mental concentration, often in the face of great physical pain. Unlike tai chi chuan or aikido, which admonishes the practitioner to "go with" the opponent, the philosophy of kendo is that it is a battle to the death and only the strongest will remain alive when the fight is over. To dominate the opponent the kendoka (someone who practices kendo) must unite his or her ki with the ki of the universe. According to Japanese belief, ki is the vital life energy flowing through all things and all people. Kendo philosophy states that the power of ki can be channeled and directed through concentration. </p><p>Kripalu Yoga </p><p>Kripalu Yoga is a modern approach to the ancient body-mind discipline of yoga. It was developed by Amrit Desai, a yoga practitioner inspired by Kripalvananda, an Indian master of kundalini yoga. The kripalu approach to yoga combines asanas, or postures, which involve folding, stretching, bending, and balancing the body in a variety of positions; pranayama, or breath control; and meditation. Kripalu Yoga is meant to give practitioners peace of mind, and good health, and to develop spiritual awareness so that their inner divinity which, according to Hindu and yogic tradition, is inherently present in everyone, can manifest itself. Kripalu yoga is taught in three specific stages. The first stage is called "willful practice." The purpose of this stage is for practitioners to learn to perform the postures correctly; to learn to take deep, full breaths; to coordinate their breaths with the movements; and to pay close attention to body alignment.</p>The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Body-Mind Disciplines <p>Body-mind is a way of seeing and understanding the human organism. To see a human being in terms of body-mind is to see him or her as a totality wherein ones physical, psychological, and spiritual aspects are all interrelated and reflective of one another. In other words, the body is not simply the material receptacle of the mind or spirit, it is the medium through which we experience, each in a unique and individual way, the unfolding, transforming nature of spirit itself. </p><p>From this perspective, the functioning of the body influences the functioning of the mind and the emotions. In a like manner, thoughts and feelings have a profound and direct effect on the body. On a deeper level, many body-mind models believe that the physical, emotional, and mental aspects of human experience are a reflection of and inextricably linked to an all-pervasive spiritual essence. In different cultures and in different times, this spiritual essence has had many names: Atman, the Tao, God, energy, the force. </p><p>A body-mind discipline is an organized program of activity that seeks to awaken and activate the links between body, mind, and spirit. The practice of a body-mind discipline may involve a variety of activities all of which aim to incorporate the physical body with the sensing, feeling, thinking, and/or intuiting faculties of the mind. Through the practice of a body-mind discipline, one develops awareness of physical sensations and mental and emotional processes. This awareness can be the basis of healing and improved health, greater efficiency and expressiveness in ones activities, more rewarding relationships and interactions, and a deeper, clearer sense of purpose in one's life. </p><p>The practice of body-mind disciplines is ancient. We have evidence that some, such as yoga and various forms of touch therapy, were widespread even well before written treatises were available. The ancient disciplines were based on one of the earliest and most perseverant of human desires -- to live a long, meaningful, and healthy life. For most of human history this meant living in a state of balance and harmony, both within oneself and within one's environment. The body-mind disciplines that evolved in all cultures addressed, each in their own particular way, the many elements that create and maintain this balance and harmony.</p></p><h2>Health, Healing, And Beyond: Yoga And The Living Tradition Of Krishnamacharya</h2><p>"My father's teaching... was based on the truth that each student must be taught according to his or her individual capacity at any given time.

His apprentice Zachary knows John is reluctant to believe anything that purports to exist outside the realm of logic. But even John cannot explain how or why Mary Toft, the wife of a local farmer, manages to give birth to a dead rabbit. When this singular event becomes a regular occurrence, John realizes that nothing in his experience as a village physician has prepared him to deal with a situation as disturbing as this. He writes to several preeminent surgeons in London, three of whom quickly arrive in the small town of Godalming ready to observe and opine. When Mary's plight reaches the attention of King George, Mary and her doctors are summoned to London, where Zachary experiences for the first time a world apart from his small-town existence, and is exposed to some of the darkest corners of the human soul. All the while, Mary lies in bed, waiting for another birth, as doubts begin to blossom among the surgeons and a growing group of onlookers grow impatient for another miracle...</p><p><b>DEXTER PALMER</b> is the author of <i>Version Control</i> and <i>The Dream of Perpetual Motion</i>, which was selected as one of the best fiction debuts of 2010 by <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>.

R. James, Bram Stoker, Edgar Allan Poe and E. F. Benson.</p><p>Bernard Capes was celebrated as one of the most prolific authors of the late Victorian period, producing dozens of short stories, articles, and more than forty novels across multiple genres, culminating in the first original crime novel published by Collins, The Skeleton Key. His greatest acclaim, however, came from penning some of the most terrifying ghost stories of the era. Yet following his death in 1918 his work all but slipped into oblivion until the 1980s, when veteran anthologist Hugh Lamb first collected Capes&#x2019;s tales of terror as The Black Reaper.</p><p>Every story bears the stamp of Capes&#x2019;s fertile and deeply pessimistic imagination, from werewolf priests and haunted typewriters to marble hands that come to life and plague-stricken villagers haunted by a scythe-wielding ghost. Now expanded with eleven further stories, a revised introduction and a new foreword by Capes&#x2019;s grandson, Ian Burns, this classic collection will thrill horror fans and restore Capes&#x2019;s reputation as one of the best writers in the horror genre.</p></p><p><p>Hugh Lamb has spent over forty years delving into weird fiction.

For Kearney, the intersecting dimensions of impossibility propel religious experience and faith in new directions, notably toward views of God that are unforeseeable, unprogrammable, and uncertain. Important themes such as the phenomenology of the persona, the meaning of the unity of God, God and desire, notions of existence and diff�rance, and faith in philosophy are taken up in this penetrating and original work. </p><p>Richard Kearney is Professor of Philosophy at Boston College and University College, Dublin.

But that plan was derailed when at age eighteen, Isabella caused a drunk-driving accident. Her family, to shield her from disgrace, sent her to Europe for acting studies, not foreseeing how life abroad would fan the romantic longings and artistic impulses that would define the rest of Isabella&#x2019;s years. In <i>Not at All What One Is Used To,</i> author Marian Janssen tells the story of this passionate, troubled woman, whose career as a poet was in constant compromise with her wayward love life and her impulsive and reckless character. </p>Life took Gardner from the theater world of the 1930s and &#x2019;40s to the poetry scene of the &#x2019;50s and &#x2019;60s to the wild, bohemian art life of New York&#x2019;s Hotel Chelsea in the &#x2019;70s. She often followed where romance, rather than career, led her. At nineteen, she had an affair with a future president of Ireland, then married and divorced three famous American husbands in succession. Turning from acting to poetry, Gardner became associate editor of Chicago&#x2019;s <i>Poetry </i>magazine and earned success with her best-received collection, <i>Birthdays from the Ocean</i>, in 1955. Soon after, her life took a turn when she met the southern poet Allen Tate. He was married to Caroline Gordon but left her to wed Gardner, who moved to Minneapolis and gave up writing to please him, but after a few short years, Tate fell for a young nun and abandoned her. In the liveliest of places at the right times, Gardner associated with many of the most significant cultural figures of her age, including her cousin Robert Lowell, T.S. Eliot, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Virgil Thomson, Tennessee Williams, and Robert Penn Warren. But famous connections could never save Isabella from herself. Having abandoned her work, she suffered through alcoholism, endured more failed relationships, and watched the lives of her children unravel fatally. Toward the end of her life, though, she took her pen back up for the poems in her final volume. Redeemed by her writing, Gardner died alone in 1981, just after being named the first poet laureate of New York State. Through interviews with many Gardner intimates and extensive archival research, author Marian Janssen delves deep into the life of a woman whose poetry, according to one friend, &#x201c;probably saved her sanity.&#x201d; Much more than a biography, <i>Not at All What One Is Used To</i> is the story of a woman whose tumultuous life was emblematic of the cultural unrest at the height of the twentieth century.<p></p></p><p>Although I have&nbsp;always devoured books, as a young Dutch girl even reading while riding my&nbsp;bike, after high school I&nbsp;was sure I&nbsp;was not cut out for university and found employment as an au-pair in London. There I&nbsp;became addicted to British novels and, back in Holland, decided to go to university after all and study Commonwealth literature.&nbsp; However, when I&nbsp;found that the youngest of my&nbsp;four brothers, a budding mathematician, had read more United States authors than I&nbsp;had, I&nbsp;switched to American literature in order to silence this show-stopper. My&nbsp;thesis on American poet-critics John Crowe Ransom and Allen Tate gained me&nbsp;my&nbsp;Master's degree (<i>cum laude) </i>at Radboud University in Nijmegen. My&nbsp;advisor, Ger Janssens, then asked me&nbsp;how I&nbsp;saw my&nbsp;future, &nbsp;and when I&nbsp;said I&nbsp;wanted to travel, he suggested I&nbsp;do so in the United States in search of materials for a doctoral dissertation on the literary magazine <i>The Kenyon Review.</i> So, I&nbsp;travelled to America, starting out at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, with its seven hundred or so souls (somewhat of a culture shock for a Dutch woman whose images of the United States had been warped by American television) and branching out to other archives nationwide. <i>The Kenyon Review (1939-1970): A Critical History </i>was published by Louisiana State University Press in 1990. Doing original research while travelling seemed a better way to earn a living than most, so I&nbsp;was happy when I&nbsp;was offered a post-doc position&nbsp;for a biography on red-haired Isabella Gardner. While checking out John Crowe Ransom's editorial correspondence at Washington University in St. Louis, I had leafed through Gardner's correspondence there and had become fascinated with this poet who had been&nbsp;married to Allen Tate--and three others. Just before I went on a year-long trip to America in search of&nbsp;Isabella Gardner, including her love life with Tate, I complicated my own love life by falling in love with the teacher who had supervised my academic work.&nbsp;Reading the love-letters between elderly Tate in Europe and Gardner in America, while keeping up an exchange from America with my&nbsp;own lover in Europe gave my&nbsp;research a whole new dimension. The Gardner-Tate relationship ended in a disastrous divorce in less than ten years, but the Janssen-Janssens one is still going strong.&nbsp; Writing the biography, however, took much longer than planned, because I, with my&nbsp;love of travelling, accepted the position of Head of the International Office at Radboud University, which meant Gardner landed on a backburner.&nbsp; For almost a decade, she simmered there, but, accompanied by Janssens and our&nbsp;red-haired son, I&nbsp;added definitive fuel during two recent sabbaticals at the University of California at Berkeley. Now I am&nbsp;back in the Netherlands at the International Office, still travelling after all these years but also still writing on the side.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think Gardner's life would make a wonderful film with Meryl Streep in the lead as Gardner looking back, while I myself&nbsp;would want to make a Hitchcockian cameo appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the liveliest of places at the right times, Gardner associated with many of the most significant cultural figures of her age, including her cousin Robert Lowell, T.S. Eliot, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Virgil Thomson, Tennessee Williams, and Robert Penn Warren. But famous connections could never save Isabella from herself.

Despite their religious and cultural differences they have loved each other since childhood, but their own tolerence does not protect them from others.</p><p>As is true of all great literature, Kurban Said's <i>Ali and Nino</i> has timeless appeal. Set in the years surrounding the Russian Revolution and the rise of the Soviet Union, Said's tale of an Azerbaijani Muslim boy in love with a Georgian Christian girl is both tender and disturbingly prescient. The novel, first published in 1937, begins as Ali Khan Shirvanshir is finishing his last year of high school: <blockquote> We were a very mixed lot, we forty schoolboys who were having a Geography lesson one hot afternoon in the Imperial Russian Humanistic High School of Baku, Transcaucasia: thirty Mohammedans, four Armenians, two Poles, three Sectarians, and one Russian. </blockquote> The multi-ethnic Baku, it seems, stands at a crossroads between West and East, and, as the smug Russian professor informs his pupils, it is their responsibility to decide "whether our town should belong to progressive Europe or to reactionary Asia." For Ali Khan Shirvanshir there is no doubt--he belongs to the East; his beloved Nino, however, is "a Christian, who eats with knife and fork, has laughing eyes and wears filmy silk stockings." <p> Far away, to the West, there are rumblings of war. When the Russian Revolution begins, Ali Khan chooses not to fight; the Czar's fate is of little interest to a Muslim living in far away Transcaucasia. But the young man senses that another, greater danger is gathering on his country's borders--an "invisible hand" trying to force his world into new ways, the ways of the West. He assures his worried father that, like his ancestors, he is willing to die in battle, but at a time of his own choosing. In the meantime, he courts Nino and eventually marries her in the teeth of scandal and opposition. This union of East and West is at times a difficult one as Ali Khan finds himself lured further and further into European ways. When Soviet troops invade, however, he must choose once and for all whether to stand for Asia or Europe. </p><p> One of the many pleasures <i>Ali and Nino</i> offers is Kurban Said's lovingly rendered evocations of Muslim culture. Another is his compassionate portrait of the protagonists' difficult but profound relationship. Modern readers coming to this novel in the wake of the fall of Communism, outbreaks of sectarian violence, and the rise of religious fundamentalism will find disturbing parallels in its cautionary chronicle of cultures colliding and a way of life brutally destroyed. In the end, however, it is not historical accuracy, but rather the charm and passion of the title characters that lifts Said's only novel into literature's highest ranks. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>First published in Vienna in 1937, this classic story of romance and adventure has been compared to <b>Dr. Zhivago</b> and <b>Romeo and Juliet</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its mysterious author was recently the subject of a feature article in the <b>New Yorker</b>, which has inspired a forthcoming biography. Out of print for nearly three decades until the hardcover re-release last year, <b>Ali and Nino</b> is Kurban Said's masterpiece. It is a captivating novel as evocative of the exotic desert landscape as it is of the passion between two people pulled apart by culture, religion, and war.<br><br>It is the eve of World War I in Baku, Azerbaijan, a city on the edge of the Caspian Sea, poised precariously between east and west.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali Khan Shirvanshir, a Muslim schoolboy from a proud, aristocratic family, has fallen in love with the beautiful and enigmatic Nino Kipiani, a Christian girl with distinctly European sensibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; To be together they must overcome blood feud and scandal, attempt a daring horseback rescue, and travel from the bustling street of oil-boom Baku, through starkly beautiful deserts and remote mountain villages, to the opulent palace of Ali's uncle in neighboring Persia.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately the lovers are drawn back to Baku, but when war threatens their future, Ali is forced to choose between his loyalty to the beliefs of his Asian ancestors and his profound devotion to Nino.&nbsp;&nbsp;Combining the exotic fascination of a tale told by Scheherazade with the range and magnificence of an epic, <b>Ali and Nino</b> is a timeless classic of love in the face of war.</p><h2>Rough Ideas: Reflections on Music and More</h2><p><p>Stephen Hough is indisputably one of the world's leading pianists, winning global acclaim and numerous awards, both for his concerts and recordings.

He also writes vividly about people he's known, places he's travelled to, books he's read, paintings he's seen; and touches on more controversial subjects, such as assisted suicide and abortion. Even religion is there - the possibility of the existence of God, problems with some biblical texts and the challenge involved in being a gay Catholic.<br>An illuminating and absorbing introduction into the life and mind of one of our great cultural figures.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Silver Casket (Something Wickedly Weird)</h2><p><p>SOMETHING WICKEDLY WEIRD IS HERE </p><p>The only thing worse than pirates are undead pirates. </p><p>He might have survived the first two books, but Stanley Buggles has hardly found a quiet life in his home of Cramdon Rock. Now there are two more dead pirates out to find Stanely, and this time there's an army with them. They want the precious key to the Silver Casket. Stanley doesn't know what's inside the Silver Casket, but he and his friends will do everything in their power to not find out.</p></p><p><p>CHRIS MOULD has won the Nottingham Children's Book Award and the Sheffield. He is married with two children and lives in Yorkshire, England.</p>In this fast-paced third volume of the Something Wickedly Weird series, Stanley Buggles and his friend Daisy run afoul of pirates risen from the grave. Background is provided for readers new to the series in an early conversation. Gypsies, a ghostly castaway, a deadly plague, and long-lost treasure add to the excitement, and the tension mounts to a final, personal battle. Black-and-white illustrations reminiscent of Ronald Searle grace almost every page, and a map helps set the stage. A suspenseful but not terribly scary English import, this is a good choice for early readers ready for fantasy-style action.

He was a well-known biographer and children&#39;s writer, and worked previously as a producer at the BBC. He wrote biographies of J. R. R. Tolkien, W. H. Auden, Benjamin Britten, Ezra Pound, C. S. Lewis and Dennis Potter. Among his many books for children were the best-selling Mr Majeika series. He also wrote several plays for the theatre and radio. A keen musician, he was a member of a 1930s-style jazz band, Vile Bodies, which was resident at the Ritz Hotel in London for a number of years. He died in 2005.Though numerous distinguished and semi-distinguished writers make an appearance here as friends or acquaintances of Waugh at university, and, in many cases, later, the Oxford set did not have the cohesion of the Bloomsbury (Cambridge) set, and this book is not so much a group portrait as a half-biography of Waugh. Graham Greene, Anthony Powell and John Betjeman get bit parts, while the likes of Cyril Connolly, Harold Acton and Nancy Mitford flit across the stage now and again. Not all that could be said about Waugh has been noted, however, and Carpenter (author of books on Tolkien, Auden and Pound) provides new and interesting detail about this talented and crusty writer who, staunchly Catholic and right-wing, lived out his pose as embattled crusader against the Age of the Common Man until he became virtually a parody of himself, and hastened his death with alcohol and drugs. Carpenter also splices his narrative with acute criticism of Waugh's work.

He wrote for The Blade (Toledo, Ohio) from 1944-1954, and for The Plain Dealer (Cleveland, Ohio) from 1954-1978. Boyer specialized in feature-length narratives of life aboard Great Lakes lake freighters, often concentrating on stories of mystery and disaster. He had many friends in the shipping trade and among the newsgatherers of the Great Lakes ports, and carefully weighed the information they gave him. He excelled in constructing a conjectural trajectory for the cargo vessels that disappeared in the great storms of the past, never being seen in again in their home port or any other harbor of refuge. Boyer discussed the 1882 foundering of the SS Asia, the 1927 disappearance of the SS Kamloops, and the 1929 foundering of the SS Milwaukee, in Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes (1968), and retold an account of the 1975 disappearance of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald in his last book, Ships and Men of the Great Lakes (1977).</p><h2>The Five Great Religions</h2><p>What beliefs lie at the heart of each of the world's five major religions?

Busted as a teenager for selling acid in the summer of 1968, Parish landed in Riker's Island. The experience changed him and after getting out he did his best to stay out of trouble, securing a job moving music equipment at the New York State Pavilion. The first show he worked was a Grateful Dead concert in July of 1969 and Parish was captivated by the music. A life seemingly headed nowhere had suddenly found its calling as he fell in quickly with a band of likeminded misfits who formed the nucleus of what would be the greatest road crew in rock 'n' roll history.<br><br>Parish traveled to California where his apprenticeship began. Working for the band for free and learning his craft, Parish got to know Jerry, Bobby, Phil, Billy and Mickey and through the years their relationships forged an unbreakable bond. He became very close with Garcia in particular, acting as his personal roadie and later manager for his solo performances and Garcia Band shows. He was there during times of trouble (like when a pimp held Garcia hostage at gunpoint in a New York hotel room), spending hours by his bedside when Garcia was in a coma in 1986, and performing the duties of best man at his wedding. He was also the last friend to see Garcia alive. <br><br>Throughout the Dead's historic run, there were parties of biblical proportion and celebrity run-ins with everybody from Bob Dylan to Frank Sinatra--but there was a dark side to life on the road and tragedy didn't just strike the musicians.<br><br>But <i>Home Before Daylight</i> is a story of friendship, of music and redemption. It is a piece of music history, one that reflects the American spirit of adventure and brotherhood. Seen through Steve Parish's eyes and experiences, The Grateful Dead's wild ride has never been so revealing.<br></p><p>The life of rock band roadie would hardly inspire the likes of say, Emile Zola. But Steve Parish's 30+ year tenure with the Grateful Dead, the Jerry Garcia Band, and its survivors makes for compelling reading, even if his low-key, often self-deprecating reportorial style can't hope to begin to unravel the complex psychology that drove the symptomatic excesses---and all too many tragedies--of the 60's most enduringly emblematic American band. There's more here than sex, drugs, and rock and roll, even if Parish's writing struggles to encompass the meaning of it all. And make no mistake; The Dead and their coterie were, in the estimation of unlikely Deadhead Joseph Campbell, nothing short of potent modern mythology evolving before his very eyes. In the fallout of one memorable backstage incident, the author even found himself parodied by John Belushi in an <i>SNL</i> skit written by Deadheads Al Franken and Tom Davis. Parish casts little judgment on the oft-debauched actions of his cohorts here, though he often stops to note the brightness of their humanity. A paradoxical marriage of unrestrained hedonism and radical Christian social conscience, The Dead's world seems to still baffle Parish. His continued wonderment at it all is one of the book's charms; his tortured sense of helplessness in the addiction-fueled decline and death of Jerry Garcia, its spiritual and musical leader, its most tragic mystery. <i>--Jerry McCulley</i>Never before has a true insider, a member of the Grateful Dead family from the band's early days through today, told the story of life on the road with the Grateful Dead. From San Francisco to Europe to Egypt and back again; from wild parties and horrible tragedies; from laughter to heartbreak--this is the inside story of the most legendary American rock 'n' roll band of all time and the tale of a man who lived it, from roadie to manager and brother.<br><br>"The Grateful Dead was all about improvisation, and Steve spoke that language with flourish...Steve was a central figure, often in the lead of what was going on backstage, in the hotels, on the airplanes, busses, boats, or whatever. If ever I get around to writing a book, you'll be reading plenty more about Steve."<br>--Bob Weir, from the foreword<br></p><h2>IF YOU ARE A HUNTER OF FOSSILS</h2><p>A fossil hunter looking for signs of an ancient sea in the rocks of a western Texas mountain describes how the area must have looked millions of years ago.</p><p></p><h2>American Dialogue: The Founders and Us</h2><p><b>The award-winning author of <i>Founding Brothers</i> and <i>The Quartet </i>now gives us a deeply insightful examination of the relevance of the views of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and John Adams to some of the most divisive issues in America today.</b><br><br>The story of history is a ceaseless conversation between past and present, and in <i>American Dialogue</i> Joseph J. Ellis focuses the conversation on the often-asked question "What would the Founding Fathers think?" He examines four of our most seminal historical figures through the prism of particular topics, using the perspective of the present to shed light on their views and, in turn, to make clear how their now centuries-old ideas illuminate the disturbing impasse of today's political conflicts. He discusses Jefferson and the issue of racism, Adams and the specter of economic inequality, Washington and American imperialism, Madison and the doctrine of original intent. Through these juxtapositions--and in his hallmark dramatic and compelling narrative voice--Ellis illuminates the obstacles and pitfalls paralyzing contemporary discussions of these fundamentally important issues.</p><p>JOSEPH J. ELLIS is the author of many works of American history including <i>Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation</i>, which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, and <i>American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson,</i> which won the National Book Award. He lives in Amherst, Massachusetts with his wife and is the father of three sons.<b>Preface</b><br><br>My Self-Evident Truth<br><br>"History is always unfinished in the sense that the future always uses its past in new ways."<br>- Peter Gay, <i>Style in History</i> (1974)<br>Self-evident truths are especially alluring because, by definition, no one needs to explain why they are true. The most famous example of this lovely paradox, which gave the term its name, is the second paragraph in the Declaration of Independence (i.e. &#x201c;We hold these truths to be self-evident&#x201d;), where Thomas Jefferson surreptitiously imbedded the creedal statement of the American promise.<br><br> The ironies abound, since Jefferson almost certainly did not know he was drafting the American Creed, and subsequent generations worshipped his words for reasons different than he intended. Moreover, his initial draft described the truths as &#x201c;sacred and undeniable,&#x201d; and it was probably Benjamin Franklin who suggested the change to &#x201c;self-evident.&#x201d; But, in the end, such nettlesome details have proven powerless against the sweeping influence of Jefferson&#x2019;s message, which defined the terms of the liberal tradition in American history.<br><br> My professional life as a writer and teacher of American history has been informed by another self-evident truth. As I try to put it into words, I worry that the very act of self-conscious articulation might drain away the unconscious magic of my working assumption and expose it as an illusion. But let me try. It goes like this: the study of history is an ongoing conversation between past and present from which we all have much to learn.<br><br> There, having said it, I can see that the formulation is helpfully vague. It does not dictate what we can learn, and therefore casts a wide net that gathers in a messy variety of both personal and public lessons. Most of my experience comes from forty-plus years of teaching in a liberal arts college, where there is less distance between students and faculty. In such schools communication does not end with graduation, but lives on in a feed-back loop about the relevance and irrelevance of what had been learned years ago.<br><br> The dominant pattern was a random and wholly unpredictable kind of relevance. There was the Chinese student who had done a research paper for me on the Massachusetts Constitution, which was drafted singlehandedly by John Adams. This served as the inspiration, so she claimed, for her work back in Shanghai, writing a putative constitution for post-communist China. At her twenty-fifth reunion another student told me that her career as a corporate executive had been influenced by two lectures on the Civil War, one from the northern, the other from the southern perspective, which helped her to think ironically. Several former students, both women and men, reported that their efforts to negotiate the inescapable tension between career and family were informed by their reading of Abigail Adams&#x2019;s letters, citing most especially her indomitable resilience.<br><br> Such examples suggest that I was not completely fooling myself in believing that history has something to teach us all, even though it was impossible to know at the moment of learning just what that something might be. Self-conscious attempts to teach or preach relevance in history are therefore unnecessary, because the connection between then and now is imbedded in the enterprise, fated to emerge in the future in unforeseeable ways. In that sense, reading history is like expanding your memory further back in time, and the more history you learn, the larger the memory bank you can draw on when life takes a turn for which you are otherwise unprepared.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> Obviously, a few reassuring testimonials from former students do not a compelling case make. But since my belief in history&#x2019;s utility was an unquestioned article of faith, it did not require overwhelming evidence, only sufficient support to sustain its credibility. And on that score the historical record provided several dramatic illustrations of a usable past that caught my eye. My two favorite examples featured John Adams during the American Revolution and Abraham Lincoln on the issue of slavery.<br><br> In June of 1776 Adams wrote to several friends in Boston, asking them to scour the Harvard library for books on military history, especially accounts of the Peloponnesian and Punic wars. He had just been appointed head of the Board of War and Ordnance, effectively making him secretary of war, a post for which he freely admitted he was wholly unprepared. He decided to give himself a crash course on how to manage an army.<br><br> Over the ensuing months he bombarded George Washington and the general officers of the Continental Army with advice gleaned from his reading. His most relevant strategic suggestion, which was based on his analysis of the battles between Thebes and Sparta as recorded by Thucydides, was to adopt a defensive strategy, what he called &#x201c;a war of posts.&#x201d; Much like the Spartans, Adams argued, the British were virtually invincible on a conventional battlefield, so the Continental Army should engage only when it enjoyed tactical superiority in numbers or terrain. Such advice cut against all of Washington&#x2019;s aggressive instincts, but he eventually, if reluctantly, embraced it. The result was a protracted war that the British had to win, while the Americans had only not to lose. This proved a more attainable goal, eventually achieved when the British abandoned the conflict after the battle of Yorktown in 1781.<br><br> In 1858 Abraham Lincoln also began a research project, in his case focused on the records of the Constitutional Convention and the early histories of that seminal event. Lincoln&#x2019;s research was prompted by the landmark Supreme Court decision, <i>Dred Scott</i> v <i>Sanford</i> (1857), in which Chief Justice Roger Taney, writing for the majority, ruled that the framers of the Constitution regarded slaves as property rather than persons, meaning that slave-owners could not be deprived of their property without their consent, which led to the conclusion that any law prohibiting slavery in the western territories was unconstitutional.<br><br> Lincoln&#x2019;s reading of history led him to a dramatically different conclusion, namely that many of the founders sought to limit slavery&#x2019;s expansion, a view which he presented in its fullest form in his Cooper Union Address (1860). He discovered that twenty-one of the thirty-nine signers of the Constitution were on record for banning or restricting slavery in the territories. Both Washington and Jefferson, as well as sixteen signers, endorsed the Northwest Ordinance, which prohibited slavery north of the Ohio River. Jefferson had even wanted to ban slavery in<i> all</i> the new territories.<br><br> As for the larger question of slavery itself, Lincoln argued that the founding generation regarded it as a moral embarrassment that clearly defied the principles announced in the Declaration of Independence, which was the major reason the delegates in Philadelphia refused to permit the toxic term to contaminate the language of the Constitution. As Lincoln described them, the founders thought of slavery as a cancer they could not surgically remove without killing the infant American republic in the cradle. Throughout the trials and tribulations of America&#x2019;s bloodiest war, Lincoln maintained he was acting as the agent of the founding generation, so that the Union cause spoke for the true meaning of the American Revolution.<br><br> It is worth noting that both Adams and Lincoln went back to the past with explicit political agendas, which is to say that they knew what they were looking for. So, for that matter, did Chief Justice Tanney, who harbored a proslavery agenda. By definition, all efforts to harvest the accumulated wisdom of the past must begin from a location in the present, so the questions posed of the past are inevitably shaped either consciously or unconsciously by the historical context in which they are asked. Unlike my former students, who discovered relevant historical insights later in life, almost accidentally, the Adams and Lincoln examples were self-conscious attempts to generate historical evidence in support of preferred outcomes. When it comes to the writing of relevant history, there are no immaculate conceptions.<br><br> This is an inconvenient truth that most historians acknowledge under their breath, admitting that objectivity, in the sense that mathematicians or physicists use the term, is not a realistic goal for historians. The best they can strive for is some measure of detachment, which serves the useful purpose of stigmatizing the most flagrant forms of ideological prejudice (i.e. cherry picking the evidence to claim that Thomas Jefferson was an evangelical Christian or Andrew Jackson a New Deal Democrat.) But if you believe that the study of history is an ongoing conversation between past and present, detachment itself is delusional. In his <i>Style in History</i> (1974) Peter Gay put the point succinctly: &#x201c;History is always unfinished in the sense that the future always uses the past in new ways.&#x201d; In fact, the past is not history, but a much vaster region of the dead, gone, unknowable or forgotten. History is what we choose to remember, and we have no alternative but to do our choosing now.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> My goal in the pages that follow is to provide a round-trip ticket to the late eighteenth century, then back to our location in the second decade of the twenty-first. The founding era has been chosen as a destination for two reasons: first, of all of the terrain in American history, I know it best; second, it produced the Big Bang that created all the planets and orbits in our political universe, thereby establishing the institutional framework for what is still an ongoing argument about our destiny as a people and a nation. Thus my title.<br><br> The questions we will be carrying back to the founding from our sliver of time in the present are inescapably shaped by our location in a divided America that is currently incapable of sustained argument and unsure of its destiny. We inhabit a backlash moment in American history of uncertain duration. Our creedal convictions as Americans, all of which have their origin in the founding era, are bumping up against four unforeseen and unprecedented obstacles: the emergence of a truly multiracial society; the inherent inequalities of a globalized economy; the sclerotic blockages of an aging political architecture; and the impossible obligations facing any world power once the moral certainties provided by the Cold War vanished. These obstacles became more difficult to negotiate in 2016, when the most inexperienced, uninformed, and divisive presidential candidate in American history occupied the Oval Office.<br><br> The <i>Now</i> sections of the ensuing chapters represent my effort to place each of these topical areas&#x2014;race, income inequality, jurisprudence, and foreign policy&#x2014;in historical context by viewing them as recent entries in longstanding patterns. The <i>Then</i> sections focus on specific founders, chosen in part because of their prominence, but mostly because, based on my previous work in their papers, each founder speaks with special resonance to the subject under scrutiny. Much in the way the founders went back to the Greek and Roman classics for guidance during the political crisis of their time, we are going back to the founders, our classics, in ours.<br><br> Our goal, then, is to learn more about our origins in the fond hope that doing so will allow us to frame the salient questions of our own time with greater wisdom than we are currently able to muster on our own. Moreover, the very act of posing such questions also enhances the prospects of viewing the founders themselves from new angles that cast their legacy in a different light. We can safely assume that the dialogue between now and then is an interactive process possessing the potential to change both sides of the chronological equation.<br><br> Although the founders are busy being dead, they still speak to use in the vast archive of letters and documents they left behind. The historical record is so rich because the revolutionary generation realized that they were &#x201c;present at the creation&#x201d; and therefore preserved their thoughts in the belief that posterity would want to remember them. Over the years, a small army of editors has worked assiduously on that preservation project, producing the fullest account of any political elite in recorded history. My attempt to recover the American Dialogue is wholly dependent on that documentary record.<br><br> Of course, the suggestion that there is an ongoing conversation across the centuries is a literary conceit, but we pay homage to the dialogue every time we cite the seminal texts of the founding to fortify our current convictions. As a lovely song once put it, the fundamental things apply, as time goes by.<br><br> In the pages that follow I will try to do justice to both sides of the dialogue. What did &#x201c;all men are created equal&#x201d; mean then and now? Did the &#x201c;pursuit of happiness&#x201d; imply the right to some semblance of economic equality? Does it now? Who were included in &#x201c;We the people&#x201d; then? Who is included now? Is it historically correct to describe the United States as an &#x201c;exceptional&#x201d; nation? If so, what are its current implications? Did the founders leave a legacy of government as &#x201c;us&#x201d; or &#x201c;them&#x201d;? If the correct answer is both, which legacy best meets our needs now?<br><br> Given our current condition as a deeply divided people, my hope is that the founding era can become a safe place to gather together, not so much to find answers to those questions as to argue about them. Indeed, if I read the founders right, their greatest legacy is the recognition that argument itself is the answer.</p><h2>Diva</h2><p>Two cassettes, a bootleg opera recording and evidence against a heroin dealer, involve Jules, a messenger, and Gorodish and Alba, two con artists, in blackmail and dangerous double crosses</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Complete Etiquette for Ladies</h2><p><p>&#x201c;In conversing with gentlemen, try to not fall into the too common practice of talking to them nothing but nonsense...&#x201d;</p><p>First published in 1876, Complete Etiquette for Ladies aimed to instruct English women of all ages and situations on the finer points of proper comportment in Victorian society.

Peter Ackroyd is&nbsp;&nbsp;"our most exciting and original writer... one of&nbsp;&nbsp;the few English writers of his generation who will&nbsp;&nbsp;be read in a hundred years' time." --&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Sunday Times</i> (London) <i>The&nbsp;&nbsp;Trial Of Elizabeth Cree</i> is without a&nbsp;&nbsp;doubt Peter Ackroyd's breakout book. It has all the&nbsp;&nbsp;erudition and literary brilliance we expect of&nbsp;&nbsp;Ackroyd, yet it is as vivid, scary, and spellbinding&nbsp;&nbsp;as the best of Edgar Allan Poe. The year is 1880,&nbsp;&nbsp;the setting London's poor and dangerous Limehouse&nbsp;&nbsp;district, home to immigrants and criminals. A&nbsp;&nbsp;series of brutal murders has occurred, and, as Ackroyd&nbsp;&nbsp;leads us down London's dark streets, the sense of&nbsp;&nbsp;time and place becomes overwhelmingly immediate&nbsp;&nbsp;and real. We experience the sights and sounds of the&nbsp;&nbsp;English music halls, smell the smells of London&nbsp;&nbsp;slums, hear the hooves of horses on the cobblestone&nbsp;&nbsp;streets, and attend the trial of Elizabeth Cree, a&nbsp;&nbsp;woman accused of poisoning her husband but who may&nbsp;&nbsp;be the one person who knows the truth about the&nbsp;&nbsp;murders. The wonderfully rhythmic shifting of focus&nbsp;&nbsp;from trial to back alleys, where we come upon&nbsp;&nbsp;George Gissing, author of <i>New Grub&nbsp;&nbsp;Street</i>, and even Karl Marx, gives the story a&nbsp;&nbsp;tremendous depth and resonance beyond its page-turning&nbsp;&nbsp;thriller plot. In <i>The Trial Of Elizabeth&nbsp;&nbsp;Cree</i>, Peter Ackroyd has once again&nbsp;&nbsp;confirmed his place as one of the great writers of our&nbsp;&nbsp;time.</p><p><b>Peter Ackroyd </b>is an award-winning historian, biographer, novelist, poet and broadcaster. He is the author of the acclaimed non-fiction bestsellers<i> London: The Biography</i>,<i> Thames: Sacred River </i>and <i>London Under</i>; biographies of figures including Charles Dickens, William Blake, Charlie Chaplin and Alfred Hitchcock; and a multi-volume history of England. He has won the Whitbread Biography Award, the Royal Society of Literature's William Heinemann Award, the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, the Guardian Fiction Prize, the Somerset Maugham Award and the South Bank Prize for Literature. He holds a CBE for services to literature.The latest from Ackroyd (English Music) is a deft, if somewhat cerebral and cold-blooded, exercise in historical crime fiction set in a late-Victorian London teeming with intellectual activity, extreme poverty and all manner of sensational public spectacles. A blend of trial transcripts, first-person accounts and microscopic biographical studies of illustrious 19th-century lives, the story is an impressive feat of historical fidelity and fictional artistry. In a marvelous coda, Ackroyd even unites his protagonists in the audience of a theater, to watch a play based on the gruesome events of the novel. The story opens with the trial and execution of former music-hall actress Elizabeth Cree, convicted of poisoning her husband, John Cree, whose diary entries suggest that he is the "Limehouse Golem," a serial killer stalking the squalid, smog-choked streets of London's Jewish district. Around these grisly deeds weave the intersecting paths of Ackroyd's nonfictional characters, including George Gissing, Karl Marx and popular theater star Dan Leno, who haunt the Reading Room of the British Museum and the chiarascuro streets of the city. The Golem's identity, in a not unexpected plot twist, is ultimately found among the protean personae of the theater world. Yet Ackroyd reminds us at every turn that his fictional whodunit enfolds a larger, unsolvable mystery, a mystery of London itself, and of the solace that its populace finds in popular spectacles of sensational crime and violence. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Reality of Retirement</h2><p>The Reality of Retirement [Mar 01, 1989] Willing, Jules Z.</p><p></p><h2>Emile Bernard, 1868-1941: A pioneer of modern art</h2><p>Hard to Find book</p><p>Text: English, German</p><h2>The Delia Collection: Fish</h2><p>Delia has chosen her best and most popular recipes updating old favorites and adding some that are completely new.

Had Peter Bergson, representing Ze'ev Jabotinsky's Revisionist Zionists in America, received government support for his plans to rescue Hitler's Jewish victims, many more might have been saved and his name might have been as well known as those of Oskar Schindler and Raoul Wallenberg. But as Wyman (The Destruction of the Jews) and Medoff (The Deafening Silence: American Jewish Leaders and the Holocaust) make clear in this simple but potent volume, Bergson's dogged efforts-advertisements in the New York Times, lobbying in Washington, a star-studded pageant called "We Will Never Die" that toured the country-were crippled in large part not only by Roosevelt's administration but by the leaders of the established American Jewish community. The latter were threatened by the Lithuanian-born, Palestine-raised Bergson's tactics and by his ties to what was considered a radical wing of the Zionist movement. What makes this book an ideal companion to Wyman's seminal Abandonment of the Jews (1984) is a transcript of a 12-hour interview he conducted with Bergson as part of his research for that volume. Much-needed context is added by interviews with other players, as well as fascinating letters and papers, including a scathing indictment of the Roosevelt administration's inaction by a Treasury Department official.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Lean Advantage 3: Four More Years</h2><p>The third in Clarence Bass' Lean Advantage series, which is an organized collection of his Ripped columns in Muscle &amp; Fitness magazine.

Here, Vollmann&#39;s gritty style perfectly serves his examination of sex, violence, and corruption.</p><p>The prolific Vollmann, fresh from a sadomasochistic survey in Thirteen Stories and Thirteen Epitaphs (p. 258), makes another savage thrust into society's sexual fringes with this fractured tale of Southeast Asian prostitutes and a journalist who couldn't say no. The ``Butterfly boy,'' first seen at school, has no friends among his male peers, instead being terrorized by them and by a bully until he is saved by a girl admirer. Ever the outcast, as an adult he travels with a photographer to Thailand and Cambodia on assignment, but the two spend far more time with the prostitutes than gathering material for a story. Unlike the photographer who uses his women without becoming interested in them, the journalist approaches them sympathetically, with an earnestness that both attracts and embarrasses them. By the time he returns to San Francisco, he's fallen in love with a Cambodian woman and become HIV-positive; he wants only to divorce his wife, however, and bring Vanna and her child to America. Unable to locate her from a distance, he begs another assignment, eventually reaching Bangkok and crossing clandestinely into Cambodia, but language difficulties and social differences keep him from achieving his goal. Under the corrosive influence of his callous fellow traveller, he allows himself to be tempted by other flesh--but in the fevered state brought on by various sexually transmitted diseases, a bottle of Benadryl is ultimately his only consolation. The flesh-peddling and sensory overload of Southeast Asia fill every page, but they're given such a weak lead that the story has nowhere to go: scenes of decay and corruption rule in unchallenged succession. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The prolific Vollmann weighs in with at least his third hyper-realized meditation on female prostitution. But whereas Whores for Gloria had an imaginative conceit worthy of Borges and Thirteen Stories and Thirteen Epitaphs teetered provocatively between a Baedeker and a Book of the Dead, his latest effort falls a bit flat. The "Butterfly Boy" grows up as a nerdish American kid who is routinely abused by bullies at school. His adolescent trials, configured against a backdrop of American atrocities in Vietnam, are relieved only by the affections of a particularly plucky girl who then moves away. This sets the stage for the protagonist's adult explorations of love and violence in the Far East, where, as "the journalist," he pals with "the photographer," and together they insist on developing relationships with a series of prostitutes. As always, Vollmann's style--gritty detail stirred with hallucinated fancy--perfectly serves his investigation of the profane, which in this case includes the vile horrors exacted by the Khmer Rouge. However, the heart of this darkness is not convincingly evoked, and readers may begin to wonder if the exoticism of the Orient and its women is not just a handy occasion for Vollmann to act out a forbidden fantasy. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dunant&#39;s Dream: War, Switzerland and the History of the Red Cross</h2><p>In 1859, Swiss businessman Henri Dunant began a crusade to provide better medical treatment for wounded soldiers, which led to the creation of the most important human rights organization in history, currently maintaining 137 societies worldwide.</p><p>When vacationing Genevan businessman Henri Dunant arrived at the resort community of Solferino, Italy, in June 1859, he certainly did not expect to find the remains of a bloody battle, concluded earlier in the day, between the Austrians and the French. The casualties, over 6,000 of them, horrified Dunant. More shocking were the survivors, left unattended on the bloody battlefield, many of them severely wounded and near death. Overcome by the brutality of the scene before him, Dunant organized and led a team of volunteers that systematically cared for the wounded. Within five years, he and four other prosperous Swiss citizens formed the International Committee for Relief to the Wounded and drafted the first Geneva Convention.<p> Renamed in 1876 the International Committee of the Red Cross, the organization today comprises 137 national societies and 250 million members. The Committee that governs it, however, has changed little since the 1870s. According to Caroline Moorehead, author of <i>Dunant's Dream: War, Switzerland and the History of the Red Cross</i>, the power to monitor and criticize all governments of the world remains "in the hands of a small band of co-opted, elderly Swiss lawyers and bankers." While the International Committee has operated staunchly on its self-prescribed principles throughout the 20th century, many of its decisions, actions, and instances of inaction have been ambiguous and seemingly motivated by politics. In <i>Dunant's Dream</i>, Moorehead, a London-based journalist, presents a scrutinizing yet balanced history of the organization. Despite its length, <i>Dunant's Dream</i> makes no attempt to be comprehensive. Instead, Moorehead, her argument supported by unprecedented access to private Red Cross archives in Geneva, analyzes the conflicts, issues, and moral dilemmas from over 130 years of war and natural disasters that have had the most determining effect on the growth of the modern Red Cross. <i>--Bertina Loeffler Sedlack</i></p>An eloquent examination of the evolution of the Red Cross from its modest inception in the mid-19th century to its present status as the world's preeminent relief organization. In 1859, Henri Jean Dunant, age 31, an idealistic scion of a prosperous Swiss family, visited the battlefield at Solferino, Italy, where in a single day 6,000 had died and more than 30,000 had been wounded. Horrified by the suffering he witnessed and by the inability of the medical personnel to cope with the sheer numbers of victims and the gravity of wounds, Dunant published A Memory of Solferino (1862), a book whose graphic battlefield descriptions appalled and animated its myriad readers. By 1863 the society that would become the Red Cross was born. Dunant's Dream is a masterwork, a book of immense power and consequence. Moorehead, a columnist for the Independent in England (Bertrand Russell: A Life, 1993, etc.), the first researcher allowed to explore the archives of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva, has emerged to tell a compelling storyboth broad in scope and rich in illuminating detail, both compassionate and critical, poignant and depressing (humanity's inhumanity has rarely been so sharply delineated). On display are Moorehead's comprehensive knowledge of world history and politics; her formidable scholarship; her lucid, felicitous style; and her impressive ability to make comprehensible the most complicated international conflicts, the most enigmatic personalities. Unafraid to censure, she repeatedly calls the organization to account for its relative silence during the Holocaust and for the conservative ``stodginess'' that has sometimes made it slow to adapt to crises. Most riveting are Moorehead's stories of the quiet heroism of individual Red Cross volunteersnurses, surgeons, stretcher-bearers, ambulance driverswho have struggled at enormous personal risk to bring relief to soldiers, refugees, orphans, political prisoners, victims of natural disastersto all who recognize the Red Cross as a symbol of hope. Dunant's Dream is a major work by a gifted writer. (32 pages photos) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The difference here is that these women don't seem to be doing this for anyone but themselves. Perhaps it's because, for the most part, they aren't the lacquered teenage breast-implantees one finds in the pages of various men's magazines. Or perhaps it's just that they look like they're having <i>fun</i> sometimes. Whatever, the photos certainly capture nuances of the act that may fascinate women who've never seen another woman masturbate (or have never done it themselves), or men curious about the workings of female sexuality minus the presence of a partner. The interesting facial expressions of the women easily hold their own against the ... <i>ahem</i> ... other body parts.</p>Michael Rosen, an English poet, scriptwriter, broadcaster, and performer, has been writing for children since 1970.

It is the story of Lena Rothman, a shirtwaist-maker and active suffragette whose plans get derailed when she falls in love with her best friend&#x2019;s boyfriend; Jake Brenner, a passionate labor organizer determined to lead the shirtwaist-makers on a high-stakes strike; and Daniel Cowan, a brilliant and ambitious night-school student hobbled by a shameful past. Fate draws them together. Emotions bind them to each other. But secrets will tear them apart. When a devastating blaze engulfs the shirtwaist factory, Lena must fight for her life. And in the chaos of the fire&#x2019;s aftermath, mistakes will be made with consequences and secrets that continue into the next generation. Spanning the first half of the twentieth century, this is a story about unforgettable characters and the threads of friendship, love, betrayal, and redemption that form the fabric of their lives. Fans of Adriana Trigiani, Kristin Hannah, and Christine Baker Kline, will love The Garment Maker&#x2019;s Daughter. It's that rare novel you&#x2019;ll be thinking about long after you&#x2019;ve finished it.</p><p>Hillary Adrienne Stern is an attorney with the Federal Government specializing in employment law. She currently lives in Bethesda, Maryland with her rescue dog Darcy. When she&#39;s not writing, she&#39;s learning Italian or going on African safaris. The Garment Maker&#39;s Daughter was inspired by stories she heard while growing up about life on the Lower East Side of New York City during the first half of the twentieth century.In the early 20th century, three immigrants stand aboard a ship sailing into Ellis Island, each with their own dreams about what coming to America will mean for them: Daniel, a Polish boy with a love of language and law, and Lena and Joe, Jewish siblings hoping for a better life. They are about to meet New Yorkers Jake, a rough labor representative, and his dazzling girlfriend, Sophie. Together, they will change one another&#x2019;s lives in ways no one could imagine. Over the next 50 years, these five friends come into and fall out of one another&#x2019;s lives through joy and pain, tragedy and triumph. But there is one secret that could tear them apart forever. The Garment Maker&#x2019;s Daughter is a beautiful multi-generational epic about life, love and the choices we make. The characters are well drawn, and the plot is refreshingly realistic, allowing both positive and negative occurrences to color the characters&#x2019; lives, rather than romantically painting over the rough patches. Stern has obviously done her research, and she effortlessly plants the reader in a variety of historically accurate settings, from stuffy shirtwaist factory workrooms to a cozy hotel in the Catskills and the opulent dining halls of the political elite. She keeps the reader on track with a few real-life event tie-ins, but the crux of the story is the relationships of its main characters, and they do not disappoint. The expert pacing kept me turning pages, and Stern&#x2019;s engaging plot had me hooked until the very last page. I highly recommend this wonderful tale of life, love and the struggle to be true to oneself as a book everyone should read.

Poetry is said to feed the soul, each poem a delicious morsel. When read aloud, the best poems provide a particular joy for the mouth. Poems about food make these satisfactions explicit and complete.</p><p>Of course, pages can and have been filled about food's elemental pleasures. And we all know food is more than food: it's identity and culture. Our days are marked by meals; our seasons are marked by celebrations. We plant in spring; harvest in fall. We labor over hot stoves; we treat ourselves to special meals out. Food is nurture; it's comfort; it's reward. While some of the poems here are explicitly about the food itself: the blackberries, the butter, the barbecue--all are evocative of the experience of eating. </p><p>Many of the poems are also about the everything else that accompanies food: the memories, the company, even the politics. Kevin Young, distinguished poet, editor of this year's <i>Best American Poetry</i>, uses the lens of food - and his impeccable taste - to bring us some of the best poems, classic and current, period. </p><p><b>Poets include:</b> <br>Elizabeth Alexander, Elizabeth Bishop, Billy Collins, Mark Doty, Robert Frost, Allen Ginsberg, Louise Gluck, Seamus Heaney, Tony Hoagland, Langston Hughes, Galway Kinnell, Frank O'Hara, Sharon Olds, Mary Oliver, Adrienne Rich, Theodore Roethke, Matthew Rohrer, Charles Simic, Tracy K.

Young is the Atticus Haygood Professor of English and Creative Writing and the curator of literary collections and the Raymond Danowski Poetry Library at Emory University in Atlanta.</p>Poets have extolled culinary indulgence since at least Anacreon and Sappho, but poet and editor Young (Ardency, 2011) includes in this anthology poems that interpret food and drink in a myriad of imaginative ways. From Pablo Neruda&#x2019;s condimental odes (&#x201c;Ode to Salt&#x201d; and &#x201c;Ode to an Onion&#x201d;) to Langston Hughes&#x2019; &#x201c;I, Too, Sing America,&#x201d; sustenance and libations play shifting and diverse roles throughout. Though gastronomic wordplay seems too easy to describe the smorgasbord of stylistic samplings in this melodious cornucopia, perhaps the &#x201c;horn of plenty&#x201d; is an appropriate figure for the anthology, as Young brings to the table a refreshingly flavorful selection of poets. It&#x2019;s fascinating to read Natasha Trethewey (&#x201c;Invocation, 1926&#x201d;) and Charles Simic (&#x201c;Watermelons&#x201d;), Gary Soto (&#x201c;The Plum&#x2019;s Heart&#x201d;), Mart�n Espada (&#x201c;Coca-Cola and Coco Fr�o&#x201d;), and works by poets of the past and to see how the poems diverge and converge.

Not executed without controversy, the restoration renewed the vivid colors of Michelangelo's greatest work--in fact, caused a reevaluation in the minds of art historians of the master's use of color. (The controversy centered on concern that restorers had taken off <i>too much</i> of the accumulated overlay of the ages and that maybe Michelangelo had himself surfaced the frescoes with a layering of varnish <i>meant</i> to subdue the vibrant coloring.) Approximately 300 photographs of the restored frescoes are brilliantly presented here, a visual enticement to enjoy the original color as well as the form and the composition of these spectacular works. Accompanying the perfect reproductions are nine essays by specialists discussing such topics as Michelangelo's preparatory drawings for the figures in the frescoes, the plaster and pigment techniques he employed, the issue of whether he used assistants or not, and his use of color.

Anderson<br>Editor of <i>The Annotated Hobbit<br></i>Once upon a time, fantasy writers were looked down upon by the literary mainstream as purveyors of mere escapism or, at best, bedtime tales fit only for children. Today fantasy novels stand atop the bestseller lists, while fantasy films smash box office records. Fantasy dominates the role-playing and computer gaming industries, and classic works in the genre are taught in schools and universities throughout the world. Credit for this amazing turnaround belongs to one man more than any other: John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, the beloved author of <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.<br><br>Terry Brooks. David Eddings. George R. R. Martin. Robin Hobb. The top names in modern fantasy all acknowledge J. R. R. Tolkien as their model and master, the author whose work first fired their imaginations and inspired them to create their own epics. But what writers influenced Tolkien himself? Sir Isaac Newton once wrote, &#x201c;If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.&#x201d; As with the scientific genius of Newton, so, too, with the literary genius of Tolkien. Now internationally recognized Tolkien expert Douglas A. Anderson has gathered the fiction of some of those giants together for the first time in a collection destined to become a classic in its own right.<br>In &#x201c;The Golden Key,&#x201d; the inspiration for Tolkien&#x2019;s short story <i>Smith of Wootton Major</i>, George MacDonald tells the tale of a boy whose quest for the end of the rainbow leads beyond the borders of the world. Andrew Lang&#x2019;s romantic tale, &#x201c;The Story of Sigurd,&#x201d; features magic rings, an enchanted sword, and a brave hero loved by two beautiful women&#x2014;and cursed by a ferocious dragon. Tolkien read E. A. Wyke-Smith&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Marvelous Land of Snergs&#x201d; to his children, delighting in these charming tales of a pixieish people &#x201c;only slightly taller than the average table.&#x201d; Also appearing in this collection is a never-before-published gem by David Lindsay, author of <i>Voyage to Arcturus</i>,<i> </i>a novel which Tolkien praised highly both as a thriller and as a work of philosophy, religion, and morals.<br><br>In stories packed with magical journeys, conflicted heroes, and terrible beasts, this extraordinary volume is one that no fan of fantasy or Tolkien should be without. These tales just might inspire a new generation of creative writers.<br><b>Tales Before Tolkien: 22 Magical Stories<br><br></b>&#x201c;The Elves&#x201d; by Ludwig Tieck<br>&#x201c;The Golden Key&#x201d; by George MacDonald<br>&#x201c;Puss-Cat Mew&#x201d; by E.

Ludwig Tieck's story of the young girl Mary and her encounter with the Elves is one of the very best stories of the German kunstm�rchen, or "literary fairy tales." Here the otherworldly and perilous nature of fa- erie that Tolkien later described is very evident.<br><br>"The Elves" was first published in volume 1 (1812) of Tieck's three-volume Phantasus. The translation into English by Thomas Carlyle first appeared in German Romance (1827).<br><br> Translated by Thomas Carlyle<br><br>Where is our little Mary?" said the father. &nbsp;&nbsp;"She is playing out upon the green there with our neighbour's boy," replied the mother.<br><br>"I wish they may not run away and lose themselves," said he; "they are so thoughtless."<br><br>The mother looked for the little ones, and brought them their evening luncheon. "It is warm," said the boy; "and Mary had a longing for the red cherries."<br><br>"Have a care, children," said the mother, "and do not run too far from home, and not into the wood; Father and I are going to the fields."<br><br>Little Andres answered: "Never fear, the wood frightens us; we shall sit here by the house, where there are people near us."<br><br>The mother went in, and soon came out again with her husband. They locked the door, and turned towards the fields to look after their labourers, and see their hay-harvest in the meadow. Their house lay upon a little green height, encircled by a pretty ring of paling, which likewise enclosed their fruit and flower garden. The hamlet stretched somewhat deeper down, and on the other side lay the castle of the Count. Martin rented the large farm from this nobleman; and was living in contentment with his wife and only child; for he yearly saved some money, and had the prospect of becoming a man of substance by his industry, for the ground was productive, and the Count not illiberal.<br><br>As he walked with his wife to the fields, he gazed cheerfully round and said: "What a different look this quarter has, Brigitta, from the place we lived in formerly! Here it is all so green; the whole village is bedecked with thick-spreading fruit-trees; the ground is full of beautiful herbs and flowers; all the houses are cheerful and cleanly, the inhabitants are at their ease: nay, I could almost fancy that the woods are greener here than elsewhere, and the sky bluer; and, so far as the eye can reach, you have pleasure and delight in beholding the bountiful Earth."<br><br>"And whenever you cross the stream," said Brigitta, "you are, as it were, in another world, all is so dreary and withered; but every traveller declares that our village is the fairest in the country far and near."<br><br>"All but that fir-ground," said her husband; "do but look back to it, how dark and dismal that solitary spot is lying in the gay scene: the dingy fir-trees with the smoky huts behind them, the ruined stalls, the brook flowing past with a sluggish melancholy."<br><br>"It is true," replied Brigitta; "if you but approach that spot, you grow disconsolate and sad, you know not why. What sort of people can they be that live there, and keep themselves so separate from the rest of us, as if they had an evil conscience?"<br><br>"A miserable crew," replied the young Farmer: "gipsies, seemingly, that steal and cheat in other quarters, and have their hoard and hiding-place here. I wonder only that his Lordship suffers them."<br><br>"Who knows," said the wife, with an accent of pity, "but perhaps they may be poor people, wishing, out of shame, to conceal their poverty; for, after all, no one can say aught ill of them; the only thing is, that they do not go to church, and none knows how they live; for the little garden, which indeed seems altogether waste, cannot possibly support them; and fields they have none."<br><br>"God knows," said Martin, as they went along, "what trade they follow; no mortal comes to them; for the place they live in is as if bewitched and excommunicated, so that even our wildest fellows will not venture into it."<br><br>Such conversation they pursued, while walking to the fields. That gloomy spot they spoke of lay aside from the hamlet. In a dell, begirt with firs, you might behold a hut, and various ruined office-houses; rarely was smoke seen to mount from it, still more rarely did men appear there; though at times curious people, venturing somewhat nearer, had perceived upon the bench before the hut, some hideous women, in ragged clothes, dandling in their arms some children equally dirty and ill-favoured; black dogs were running up and down upon the boundary; and, of an evening, a man of monstrous size was seen to cross the footbridge of the brook, and disappear in the hut; and, in the darkness, various shapes were observed, moving like shadows round a fire in the open air. This piece of ground, the firs and the ruined huts, formed in truth a strange contrast with the bright green landscape, the white houses of the hamlet, and the stately new-built castle.<br><br>The two little ones had now eaten their fruit; it came into their heads to run races; and the little nimble Mary always got the start of the less active Andres. "It is not fair," cried Andres at last: "let us try it for some length, then we shall see who wins."<br><br>"As thou wilt," said Mary; "only to the brook we must not run."<br><br>"No," said Andres; "but there, on the hill, stands the large pear-tree, a quarter of a mile from this. I shall run by the left, round past the fir-ground; thou canst try it by the right over the fields; so we do not meet till we get up, and then we shall see which of us is swifter."<br><br>"Done," cried Mary, and began to run; "for we shall not mar one an- other by the way, and my father says it is as far to the hill by that side of the gipsies's house as by this."<br><br>Andres had already started, and Mary, turning to the right, could no longer see him. "It is very silly," said she to herself: "I have only to take heart, and run along the bridge, past the hut, and through the yard, and I shall certainly be first." She was already standing by the brook and the clump of firs. "Shall I? No; it is too frightful," said she. A little white dog was standing on the farther side, and barking with might and main. In her terror, Mary thought the dog some monster, and sprang back. "Fy! fy!" said she: "the dolt is gone half way by this time, while I stand here considering." The little dog kept barking, and, as she looked at it more narrowly, it seemed no longer frightful, but, on the contrary, quite pretty; it had a red collar round its neck, with a glittering bell; and as it raised its head, and shook itself in barking, the little bell sounded with the finest tinkle. "Well, I must risk it!" cried she, "I will run for life; quick, quick, I am through; certainly to Heaven, they cannot eat me up alive in half a minute!" And with this, the gay, courageous little Mary sprang along the footbridge; passed the dog, which ceased its barking and began to fawn on her; and in a moment she was standing on the other bank, and the black firs all round concealed from view her father's house, and the rest of the landscape.<br><br>But what was her astonishment when here! The loveliest, most variegated flower-garden, lay round her; tulips, roses and lilies were glittering in the fairest colours; blue and gold-red butterflies were wavering in the blossoms; cages of shining wire were hung on the espaliers, with many-coloured birds in them, singing beautiful songs; and children, in short white frocks, with flowing yellow hair and brilliant eyes, were frolicking about; some playing with lambkins, some feeding the birds, or gathering flowers, and giving them to one another; some, again, were eating cherries, grapes and ruddy apricots. No hut was to be seen; but instead of it, a large fair house, with a brazen door and lofty statues, stood glancing in the middle of the space. Mary was confounded with surprise, and knew not what to think; but, not being bashful, she went right up to the first of the children, held out her hand, and wished the little creature good-even.<br><br>"Art thou come to visit us, then?" said the glittering child; "I saw thee running, playing on the other side, but thou wert frightened at our little dog."<br><br>"So you are not gipsies and rogues," said Mary, "as Andres always told me? He is a stupid thing, and talks of much he does not understand."<br><br>"Stay with us," said the strange little girl; "thou wilt like it well."<br><br>"But we are running a race."<br><br>"Thou wilt find thy comrade soon enough. There, take and eat."<br><br>Mary ate, and found the fruit more sweet than any she had ever tasted in her life before; and Andres, and the race, and the prohibition of her parents, were entirely forgotten.<br><br>A stately woman, in a shining robe, came towards them, and asked about the stranger child. "Fairest lady," said Mary, "I came running hither by chance, and now they wish to keep me."<br><br>"Thou art aware, Zerina," said the lady, "that she can be here but for a little while; besides, thou shouldst have asked my leave."<br><br>"I thought," said Zerina, "when I saw her admitted across the bridge, that I might do it; we have often seen her running in the fields, and thou thyself hast taken pleasure in her lively temper. She will have to leave us soon enough."<br><br>"No, I will stay here," said the little stranger; "for here it is so beautiful, and here I shall find the p...</p><h2>Dayworld Breakup (Dayworld Trilogy, III)</h2><p>William Duncan, the rebel daybreaker, and his lover, Panthea Snick, set out to reveal the dark secrets of Dayworld and the formula for long life and to end the repressive hegemony</p><p>William St. George Duncan successfully takes over his grandfather's secret organization and uses it to start a rebellion against the world government. As a political statement, he allows himself to be captured and put on trial--and then creates a new persona to escape the consequences. In this last installment of the Dayworld trilogy, the novelty of the guiding SF conceit (that overpopulation is controlled by allowing only one-seventh of the people out of stasis at any one time) has grown threadbare--as has, perhaps, Farmer's own enthusiasm. The conflicts here are developed without inspiration; the conquerors earn their victory chiefly because of the opposition's bumbling. Plot elements combine without achieving momentum, as if Farmer had strung together a series of short escapades. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Idiot,the</h2><p>Towards the end of November, during a thaw, at nine o&#x2019;clock one morning, a train on the Warsaw and Petersburg railway was approaching the latter city at full speed. The morning was so damp and misty that it was only with great difficulty that the day succeeded in breaking; and it was impossible to distinguish anything more than a few yards away from the carriage windows. Some of the passengers by this particular train were returning from abroad; but the third-class carriages were the best filled, chiefly with insignificant persons of various occupations and degrees, picked up at the different stations nearer town. All of them seemed weary, and most of them had sleepy eyes and a shivering expression, while their complexions generally appeared to have taken on the colour of the fog outside. When day dawned, two passengers in one of the third-class carriages found themselves opposite each other. Both were young fellows, both were rather poorly dressed, both had remarkable faces, and both were evidently anxious to start a conversation. If they had but known why, at this particular moment, they were both remarkable persons, they would undoubtedly have wondered at the strange chance which had set them down opposite to one another in a third-class carriage of the Warsaw Railway Company. One of them was a young fellow of about twenty-seven, not tall, with black curling hair, and small, grey, fiery eyes. His nose was broad and flat, and he had high cheek bones; his thin lips were constantly compressed into an impudent, ironical&#x2014;it might almost be called a malicious&#x2014;smile; but his forehead was high and well formed, and atoned for a good deal of the ugliness of the lower part of his face. A special feature of this physiognomy was its death-like pallor, which gave to the whole man an indescribably emaciated appearance in spite of his hard look, and at the same time a sort of passionate and suffering expression which did not harmonize with his impudent, sarcastic smile and keen, self-satisfied bearing. He wore a large fur&#x2014;or rather astrachan&#x2014;overcoat, which had kept him warm all night, while his neighbour had been obliged to bear the full severity of a Russian November night entirely unprepared. His wide sleeveless mantle with a large cape to it&#x2014;the sort of cloak one sees upon travellers during the winter months in Switzerland or North Italy&#x2014;was by no means adapted to the long cold journey through Russia, from Eydkuhnen to St. Petersburg. The wearer of this cloak was a young fellow, also of about twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age, slightly above the middle height, very fair, with a thin, pointed and very light coloured beard; his eyes were large and blue, and had an intent look about them, yet that heavy expression which some people affirm to be a peculiarity as well as evidence, of an epileptic subject. His face was decidedly a pleasant one for all that; refined, but quite colourless, except for the circumstance that at this moment it was blue with cold. He held a bundle made up of an old faded silk handkerchief that apparently contained all his travelling wardrobe, and wore thick shoes and gaiters, his whole appearance being very un-Russian. His black-haired neighbour inspected these peculiarities, having nothing better to do, and at length remarked, with that rude enjoyment of the discomforts of others which the common classes so often show: &#x201c;Cold?&#x201d; &#x201c;Very,&#x201d; said his neighbour, readily, &#x201c;and this is a thaw, too. Fancy if it had been a hard frost! I never thought it would be so cold in the old country. I&#x2019;ve grown quite out of the way of it.&#x201d; &#x201c;What, been abroad, I suppose?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes, straight from Switzerland.&#x201d; &#x201c;Wheugh! my goodness!&#x201d; The black-haired young fellow whistled, and then laughed.</p><p>Returning to Russia from a sanitarium in Switzerland, the Christ-like epileptic Prince Myshkin finds himself enmeshed in a tangle of love, torn between two women--the notorious kept woman Nastasya and the pure Aglaia--both involved, in turn, with the corrupt, money-hungry Ganya. In the end, Myshkin&#39;s honesty, goodness, and integrity are shown to be unequal to the moral emptiness of those around him. In her revision of the Garnett translation, Anna Brailovsky has corrected inaccuracies wrought by Garnett&#39;s drastic anglicization of the novel, restoring as much as possible the syntactical structure of the original.&#x201c;Nothing is outside Dostoevsky&#x2019;s province. . . .

After being honorably discharged in 1966, he returned to central New York. He is married and has four adult children. Mr. Griffin began his career in investigations and law enforcement in 1975, when Pinkerton, Inc. hired ...him as a private investigator. His duties included insurance fraud, missing persons, financial and background investigations, as well as undercover operations. In 1979 the Madison County, New York Department of Social Services hired him as a Senior Child Support Investigator. He was responsible for locating and conducting financial investigations of persons failing to provide legally mandated child support. In 1981 he joined the Madison County Sheriff&#39;s Department, and attained the rank of sergeant. He was a shift supervisor and public information officer. During the same time-period, he moonlighted as a part time patrolman for the Village of Chittenango Police Department. In 1987 Mr. Griffin was hired by the New York State Department of Health as Director of Investigations, Wadsworth Center. The primary mission of his unit was to investigate violations of the Public Health Law relating to clinical and environmental laboratories, and health care fraud. He was responsible for hiring and training investigators, case assignments and general supervision. In addition, he personally handled the more difficult and complex investigations. Many of these cases received both local and national media attention. He retired in 1995. In 1996, Dennis was supposed to be retired, but decided to tell the story of what he learned while investigating the operation of a medical examiner&#39;s office. It was an eye-opening experience and he felt compelled to share it with others. Dennis eventually authored a fictionalized account called, The Morgue. However, readers didn&#39;t believe anything in the book could actually happen, but they liked the story and his style; rough edges and all. Six more mystery/thriller fictions followed. The author is an active member of the Police Writers Association. He attended Onondaga County Community College, Mohawk Valley Community College and the Central New York Regional Academy for Police Training. He has three other novels published through 1stBooks. The first, The Morgue, was published 1999. Red Gold, followed in 2000. In January 2002, his writing career was at a crossroads. Would he continue the uphill struggle for recognition in a genre with a number of well-established authors? Or was it time to find another hobby? The question was answered at a writers&#39; conference when a lady suggested Dennis try his hand at police-related non-fiction. That was the turning point. He began writing Policing Las Vegas, the history of law enforcement in Las Vegas and Clark County from 1905 thru 2004. Policing was released in April 2005. Writing that book opened his eyes to some interesting things about Las Vegas and the mob that he wanted to explore; leading to his second non-fiction book, The Battle for Las Vegas, the story of the Vegas reign of Chicago mob enforcer Tony Spilotro. In the movie Casino, actor Joe Pesci played a character based on Spilotro. The Battle for Las Vegas was released on July 1, 2006. In writing that book, Dennis relied heavily on resources such as retired FBI agents and police detectives from that era, and through his conversations with career criminal and former Spilotro lieutenant Frank Cullotta. Those conversations led to a third Vegas-based non-fiction, CULLOTTA - The Life of a Chicago Criminal, Las Vegas Mobster, and Government Witness, released nationally in July 2007. Since that time, Dennis has written several books on the true stories of the Las Vegas mob and the era in which they reigned. In 2007 Denny began hosting his own Internet radio show on Blog Talk Radio.<p><strong><em>"For nearly forty years Orlando 'Ori' Spado was a friend and associate of John 'Sonny' Franzese, underboss of the Colombo organized crime family.

The book begins with a description of the extraordinary setting of Brimnes, a small fishing village on the Arctic Circle. From his house, Holm captures Iceland&#x2019;s warmth and genuine community, its secularism, pacifism, and love of nature, poetry, and music. Writing of the America to which his ancestors fled only two generations before, he wonders whether the compelling dream of liberty, freedom, and inquiry still animates his native country. For the legions of Bill Holm fans as well as for those yearning for some straight if often comical reflection on the state of America today, this book provides a memorable experience.</p><p></p><h2>Bulls Bears and the Ballot Box: How the Performance of OUR Presidents Has Impacted YOUR Wallet</h2><p><p>Which U.S. Presidents have been the best and worst economic stewards for our nation, the business community, and the average American family?&nbsp; Which political party has demonstrated superior economic performance while serving in the White House?

Antonio Bernal is a Guatemalan refugee haunted by memories of his wife and child murdered at the hands of a man marked with a yellow tattoo. Not far from Antonio's apartment, Guillermo Longoria extends his arm and reveals a tattoo--yellow pelt, black spots, red mouth. It is the mark of the death squad, the Jaguar Battalion of the Guatemalan army. A chance encounter ignites a psychological showdown between these two men who discover that the war in Central America has followed them to the quemazones, the "great burning" of the Los Angeles riots.</p><p>An extraordinary novel, beautifully observed and driven by moral passion.If you are brave enough to travel through the seedier parts of downtown Los Angeles, you can see several of the sites that are the backdrop of my novel: homeless camps in abandoned tunnels, the brick tenements that are home to thousands of Central American immigrants, and the shopping strips that were turned to cinder and ash a few years back. <p>At its root, <i>The Tattooed Soldier</i> is the story of the conflict between the idea of Los Angeles as a place of unlimited freedom and opportunity, and the truth of the poverty and decay that have come to eat away at the very heart of the city. These concerns parallel my own dual life as a native Angeleno with roots in Guatemala. While I was growing up in affluent, ever-optimistic Southern California in the 1960s and 1970s, my family in Central America lived under a violent anti-Communist dictatorship. A war was being waged in Guatemala, just one of the many conflicts known collectively as the Cold War, all fought in the name of preserving the Pax Americana. </p><p>Eventually Los Angeles itself--perhaps the quintessential American city of the Cold War era--paid a price for maintaining the empire. I saw this firsthand when, in the late 1980s, I became a reporter for the Los Angeles Times and ventured into neighborhoods that had been assaulted by recession and the austerity of Reaganomics. Many of these neighborhoods were flooded with war refugees. It was here that I met the people and heard the stories that coalesced into <i>The Tattooed Soldier</i>.</p></p><h2>New Avengers Vol. 2: Sentry</h2><p>The Avengers try to help the most powerful super-hero in the world figure out who he is and where he came from!

Chapter authors are respected scholars in Maine history from the fields of archaeology, anthropology, ethnic studies, and the various subdisciplines of history:?political, cultural, economic, labor, military, maritime. Caught up at times in national events, Maine has also led the nation in important ways. Its fishing industry fed and its textile industry clothed the nation&#x2019;s people. Maine loggers contributed heavily to the technologies used in cutting, hauling, and driving timber. Maine excelled in the production of wooden ships and supplied the expertise to sail them. In the nineteenth century Maine&#x2019;s political leaders were among the most powerful in the nation, and Maine&#x2019;s contribution to social reform attracted national recognition. All these subjects and others are explored in a narrative that encompasses Maine&#x2019;s prehistory and its native people; the era of European exploration and settlement; Indian wars, revolution, and statehood; the logging, fishing, and maritime industries; family and community life; economics and politics; the arts and culture; and much more. Maine: The Pine Tree State will be an authoritative resource about Maine history for years to come.</p><p></p><h2>Forward</h2><p>&#34;Abby Wambach has always pushed the limits of what is possible.

Trust me.</p><p>When Dr. DuPont put that sword&#x2014;well, scimitar&#x2014;on my neck, I didn&#x2019;t feel scared, like, at all. Instead, I felt that tingle in my chest again, only this time, it was more like this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. energy.</p><p>I reached out, almost like my hands didn&#x2019;t belong to me, and grabbed the hilt of the sword, just above Dr. DuPont&#x2019;s hands on the handle, and yanked, sliding that lethal blade in the space between my arm and my body.</p><p>Dr. DuPont was so surprised he didn&#x2019;t even let go of the sword, which was exactly what I had planned, although where that plan came from, I had no idea. Certainly not from that lame self-defense class, where the only thing I&#x2019;d learned was how to knee a guy in the groin, and trust me, teenage girls already know how to do that. No, this was a different kind of fighting, one so smooth and powerful that I felt like I was standing outside my body, watching myself pull Dr. DuPont right up to me.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t knee him in the groin, although I didn&#x2019;t rule that move out. Instead I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ugh, this is so embarrassing.</p><p>I head-butted him.</p><p>I know, like a soccer hooligan or something. But it worked. He let go of the sword with one hand and reached up to clutch his probably broken nose.</p><p>I&#x2019;d kept my hand on the hilt, and I used it to pull him past me and slam him headfirst into the wall. Now I had a clear shot for the door, but for some reason, I didn&#x2019;t take it. For one thing, all this ninja-style fighting was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, kind of cool. I had no idea how I was doing it, and I wondered if it was another adrenaline thing, like when I was able to push Mr. Hall off me. But it wasn&#x2019;t just that I was having fun. It was almost like I couldn&#x2019;t leave; like I had to finish the fight until one of us was dead.</p><p>See?

We were standing outside of our school, Grove Academy. It was late October, and the night was surprisingly cool; in Pine Grove, Alabama, where I live, it&#x2019;s not unheard of to have a hot Halloween. But that night felt like fall, complete with that nice smoky smell in the air. I was super relieved that it was cold, because my jacket was wool, and there was nothing more tragic than a girl sweating in wool. I was wearing the jacket over a knee-length pink sheath dress. If I was going to be crowned Homecoming Queen tonight&#x2014;and that seemed like a lock&#x2014;I was going to do it looking as classy as possible in my demure pink dress and pearls.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you nervous?&#x201d; Bee asked as I rubbed my hands up and down my arms. Like me, Bee was in pink, but her dress was closer to magenta and the bodice was covered in tiny sequins that winked and shivered in the parking lot lights. Or maybe that was just Bee. <i>Un</i>like me, she hadn&#x2019;t worn a jacket.</p><p>Our dates, Brandon and Ryan, were off searching for a parking place. They had been annoyed that Bee and I had insisted on not showing up until the thirty minutes before the crowning, but there was no way I was going to risk getting punch spilled on me or my makeup sliding off my face (not to mention the sweatiness! See above, re: wool jacket) before I had that sparkly tiara on my head. I planned on looking <i>fierce</i> in the yearbook pictures.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m not nervous,&#x201d; I told Bee. And it was true, I wasn&#x2019;t. Okay, maybe I was a little bit <i>anxious</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Bee gave an exaggerated eye roll. &#x201c;Seriously? Harper Jane Price, you have not been able to successfully lie to me since the Second-Grade Barbie Incident. Admit that you&#x2019;re freaking out.&#x201d; She held up one hand, pinching her thumb and forefinger together. &#x201c;Maybe a leeeeeetle bit?&#x201d;</p><p>Laughing, I caught her hand and pulled it down. &#x201c;Not even a &#x2018;leeeeeetle bit.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s just Homecoming.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, but you&#x2019;re going to get all queenly tonight. I think that warrants <i>some</i> nerves. Or are you saving them for Cotillion?&#x201d;</p><p>Just the word sent all the nerves Bee could have wanted jittering through my system, but before I could admit that, her dark eyes suddenly went wide. &#x201c;Omigod! Harper! Your lips!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I asked, raising a hand to them.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re nekkid,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You are totally gloss-less!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s &#x2018;nekkid&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>I looked up to see the boys walking toward us. The orange lights played up the red in Ryan&#x2019;s hair, and he was grinning, his hands in his pockets. I felt that same little flutter in my stomach that I&#x2019;d been feeling since the first day I saw Ryan Bradshaw, way back in the third grade. It had taken me six years from that day to make him my boyfriend, but looking at him now, I had to admit, it had been worth the wait.</p><p>&#x201c;My lips,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I must&#x2019;ve wiped off all my gloss at the restaurant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, damn,&#x201d; he said, throwing his arm around my shoulders. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d hoped for something a little more exciting. Of course, no lip gloss means I can safely do this.&#x201d;</p><p>He lowered his head and kissed me, albeit pretty chastely. PDA is vile, and Ryan, being my Perfect Boyfriend, knows how I feel about it.</p><p>&#x201c;Hope you girls are happy,&#x201d; Brandon said when we broke apart. He had both of his arms wrapped around Bee from behind, his hands clasped right under her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. um, abundant assets. Bee was so tall that Brandon&#x2019;s chin barely cleared her shoulder. &#x201c;We had to park way down the effing road.&#x201d;</p><p>Okay, I should probably mention right here that Brandon used the real word, but this is my story, so I&#x2019;m cleaning it up a little. Besides, if I honestly quoted Brandon, this thing would look like a <i>Cops</i> transcript.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say that word!&#x201d; I snapped.</p><p>Brandon rolled his eyes. &#x201c;What the hell, Harper, are you, like, the language police?&#x201d;</p><p>I pressed my lips together. &#x201c;I just think that the F-word should be saved for dire occasions. And having to park a hundred yards from the gym is not a dire occasion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So sorry, Your Highness,&#x201d; Brandon said, scowling as Bee elbowed him in the ribs.</p><p>&#x201c;Easy, dude,&#x201d; Ryan said, shooting Brandon a warning look.</p><p>Ignoring Brandon, I turned to Bee. &#x201c;Do you have any lip gloss? I completely spaced on bringing any.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My girl forgot makeup?&#x201d; Ryan asked, quirking an eyebrow. &#x201c;Man, you <i>are</i> stressed about this Queen thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not,&#x201d; I said immediately, even though, hello, I clearly was. But I didn&#x2019;t like when people used the &#x201c;S-word&#x201d; around me. After all, a big part of my reputation at the Grove was my ability to handle anything and everything.</p><p>Ryan raised his hands in apology. &#x201c;Okay, okay, sorry. But, I mean, this is obviously pretty important to you, or you wouldn&#x2019;t have spent over a grand on that outfit.&#x201d; He smiled again, shaking his head so his hair fell over his eyes. &#x201c;I really hope your tastes get cheaper if we get married.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hear that, man,&#x201d; Brandon said, lifting his hand to high-five Ryan. &#x201c;Chicks gonna break us.&#x201d;</p><p>Bee rolled her eyes again, but I didn&#x2019;t know whether it was at the guys or the fact that my outfit was over a thousand dollars&nbsp;(yes, I know that&#x2019;s a completely ridiculous amount for a seventeen-year-old girl to spend on a Homecoming dress, but, hey, I can wear it, like, a million times provided I don&#x2019;t gain five pounds. Or at least that was how I rationalized it to my mom.)</p><p>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d; Bee thrust a tube into my hand.</p><p>I held it up to read the name on the bottom. &#x201c;&#x2018;Salmon Fantasy&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s close to the shade you wear.&#x201d; Bee&#x2019;s long blond hair was woven into a fishtail braid, and she tossed it over her shoulder as she handed me the lip gloss.</p><p>&#x201c;I wear &#x2018;Coral Shimmer.&#x2019; That is very different.&#x201d;</p><p>Bee made a face that said, &#x201c;I am only tolerating you because we&#x2019;ve been best friends since we were five,&#x201d; but I kept going, drawing myself up to my full height with mock imperiousness, &#x201c;And Salmon Fantasy has to be the grossest beauty product name ever. Who has fantasies about salmon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;People who screw fish,&#x201d; Brandon offered, completely cracking himself up. Ryan didn&#x2019;t laugh, but I saw the corners of his mouth twitching.</p><p>&#x201c;So witty, Bran,&#x201d; I muttered, and this time, when Bee rolled her eyes, I had no doubt that it was at the guys.</p><p>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; she said to me, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s either Salmon Fantasy or naked lips. Your choice.&#x201d;</p><p>I sighed and clutched the tube of lip gloss. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m gonna have to find a bathroom.&#x201d; If it had been my Coral Shimmer, I could have put it on without a mirror, but there was no way I was slapping on a new shade sight unseen. Ryan pulled open the gym door, and I ducked under his arm to walk into the gym. As soon as I did, I could hear the opening riff of &#x201c;Sweet Home Alabama.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s not a dance until someone plays that song.</p><p>The gym looked great, and my chest tightened with pride. I know everyone, even Ryan, thinks I&#x2019;m crazy to do all the stuff I do at school, but I honestly love the place. I love its redbrick buildings, and the chapel bells that ring to signal class changes. I love that both my parents went here, and their parents before them. So yeah, maybe I do stretch myself a little thin, but it&#x2019;s completely worth it. The Grove is a happy place to go to school, and I liked to think my good example was the reason for that. And it meant that when people thought of the name &#x201c;Price&#x201d; at Grove Academy, they&#x2019;d think of all the good things I&#x2019;d done for the school, and not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. other stuff.</p><p>Instead, I focused on the decorations. I&#x2019;m SGA president&#x2014;the first-ever junior to be elected to the position, I should add&#x2014;so Homecoming activities are technically my responsibility. But tonight, I&#x2019;d delegated all of the decorating to my prot�g�e, sophomore class president, Lucy McCarroll. My only contribution had been to ban crepe streamers and balloon arches. Can you say tacky?</p><p>Lucy had done a great job. The walls were covered in a silky, shimmery purple material and there were colored lights pulsating with the music. Looking over at the punch table, I saw that she&#x2019;d even brought in a little fountain with several bistro tables clustered around it.</p><p>I scanned the crowd until I saw Lucy, and when I caught her eye, I gave her the thumbs-up, and mouthed, &#x201c;Nice!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Harper!&#x201d; I heard someone cry. I turned around to see Amanda and Abigail Foster headed my way. They were identical twins, but relatively easy to tell apart since Amanda always wore her long brown hair up, and Abigail wore hers down. Tonight, both were wearing green dresses with spaghetti straps, but Amanda&#x2019;s was hunter green while Abigail&#x2019;s was closer to seafoam.</p><p>The twins were on the cheerleading squad with me and Bee, and Abi and I worked together on SGA. Right behind them was Mary Beth Riley, wobbling on her high heels. Next to me, Bee blew out a long breath before muttering, &#x201c;Maybe no one will notice if she wears tennis shoes under her dress.&#x201d;</p><p>Despite Bee&#x2019;s low tone, Mary Beth heard her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m working on it,&#x201d; she said, glaring at Bee. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get better by Cotillion.&#x201d;</p><p>Since &#x201c;Riley&#x201d; came right after &#x201c;Price&#x201d; alphabetically, Mary Beth would be following me down the giant staircase at Magnolia House, the mansion where Cotillion was held every year. So far, we&#x2019;d only had two practices, but Mary Beth had tripped and nearly fallen directly on top of me both times.</p><p>Which was why I&#x2019;d suggested she start wearing the heels every day.</p><p>&#x201c;Speaking of that,&#x201d; Amanda said, laying a hand on my arm. Even under her makeup, I could see the constellation of freckles arcing across her nose. That was another way to tell the twins apart; Abi&#x2019;s nose was freckle free. &#x201c;We got an e-mail from Miss Saylor right before we left for the dance. She wants to schedule another practice Monday afternoon.&#x201d;</p><p>I bit back a sigh. I had a Future Business Leaders of America meeting Monday after school, so that would have to be moved. Maybe Tuesday? No, Tuesday was cheerleading practice, and Wednesday was SGA. Still, when Saylor Stark told you there was going to be an extra Cotillion practice, you went. All the other stuff could wait.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sick of practice,&#x201d; Mary Beth groaned, tipping her head back. As she did, her dark red hair fell back from her ears, revealing silver hoops that were way too big. Ugh. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s <i>Cotillion</i>. We wear a white dress. We walk down some stairs, we drink some punch and dance with our dads. And then we all pat ourselves on the back and pretend we did it just to raise money for charity, and that it&#x2019;s not stupid and old-fashioned and totally self-indulgent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mary Beth!&#x201d; Amanda gasped, while Abigail glanced around like Miss Saylor was going to swoop out of the rafters. Bee&#x2019;s huge eyes went even bigger, and her mouth opened and closed several times, but no sounds came out.</p><p>&#x201c;It is not!&#x201d; I heard someone practically shriek. Then I realized it was <i>me.</i> I took a deep breath through my nose and did my best to make my voice calm as I continued. &#x201c;I just mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mary Beth, Cotillion is a lot more than wearing a white dress and dancing with your dad. It&#x2019;s <i>tradition</i>. It&#x2019;s when we make the transition from girls to women. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. important.&#x201d;</p><p>Mary Beth chewed her lip and studied me for a moment. &#x201c;Okay, maybe.&#x201d; Then she shrugged and gave a tiny smile. &#x201c;But we&#x2019;ll see how you feel when I&#x2019;m &#x2018;transitioning&#x2019; into a heap at the bottom of those stairs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do fine,&#x201d; I told her, hoping I sounded more convinced than I felt. I&#x2019;d spent months preparing for my Homecoming coronation, but Cotillion? I&#x2019;d been getting ready for <i>that</i> since I was four years old and Mom had shown me and my older sister, Leigh-Anne, her Cotillion dress. I still remembered the smooth feel of the silk under my hands. It had been her grandmother&#x2019;s dress, Mom had told us, and one day, Leigh-Anne and I would wear it, too.</p><p>Two years ago, Leigh-Anne had, but for my Cotillion, I&#x2019;d be wearing a dress Mom and I had bought last summer in Mobile.</p><p>&#x201c;Babe!&#x201d; I heard Ryan call from behind me.</p><p>As I turned to smile at him, I heard one of the girls sigh. Probably Mary Beth. And I had to admit, striding toward us, his auburn hair flopping over his forehead, shoulders back, hands in his pockets, Ryan was completely sigh-worthy. I held my hand out to him as he approached, and he slipped it easily into his own.</p><p>&#x201c;Ladies,&#x201d; Ryan said, nodding at Amanda, Abigail, and Mary Beth. &#x201c;Let me guess. Y&#x2019;all are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. plotting world domination?&#x201d;</p><p>Mary Beth giggled, which had the unfortunate effect of making her wobble ev...</p></p><h2>Drowning Lessons</h2><p>Winner of the 2005 Trillium Award for Poetry -- Because the poems in Drowning Lessons have been written over an extended period of time - and not with any particular idea in mind - I find it difficult to describe how or why they belong together. Reading through the MS I see certain recurrences, perhaps obsessions. I think the poems are haunted by absence, loss, things forgotten or missing, a certain experience of insubstantiality. Many of them take place underwater, both literally and figuratively. There&#39;s a great deal of drowning in these poems, though in only three instances is it a literal drowning I&#39;m writing about. The poems seem often expressions of grief, but a grief that is (perhaps) hidden or unconscious, that doesn&#39;t know its own name. It&#39;s as if something presses forward to be seen or expressed, but does not necessarily make itself fully visible. -- I suppose it&#39;s accurate to say that I think of this collection as a form of autobiography (though perhaps not an entirely trustworthy one). (And on second thought, is any autobiography entirely trustworthy?) Certainly memory and the past and the way things not dealt with persist in returning for attention are some of the experiences underlying the book. As is the way consciousness moves and shifts. -Maureen Scott Harris</p><p>MAUREEN SCOTT HARRIS is a poet and essayist based in Toronto.

Landes tells the long, fascinating story of wealth and power throughout the world: the creation of wealth, the paths of winners and losers, the rise and fall of nations. He studies history as a process, attempting to understand how the world&#39;s cultures lead to - or retard - economic and military success and material achievement. Countries of the West, Landes asserts, prospered early through the interplay of a vital, open society focused on work and knowledge, which led to increased productivity, the creation of new technologies, and the pursuit of change. Europe&#39;s key advantage lay in invention and know-how, as applied in war, transportation, generation of power, and skill in metalwork. Even such now banal inventions as eyeglasses and the clock were, in their day, powerful levers that tipped the balance of world economic power. Today&#39;s new economic winners are following much the same roads to power, while the laggards have somehow failed to duplicate this crucial formula for success. The key to relieving much of the world&#39;s poverty lies in understanding the lessons history has to teach us - lessons uniquely imparted in this towering work of history.</p><p>Professor David S. Landes takes a historic approach to the analysis of the distribution of wealth in this landmark study of world economics. Landes argues that the key to today&#39;s disparity between the rich and poor nations of the world stems directly from the industrial revolution, in which some countries made the leap to industrialization and became fabulously rich, while other countries failed to adapt and remained poor. Why some countries were able to industrialize and others weren&#39;t has been the subject of much heated debate over the decades; climate, natural resources, and geography have all been put forward as explanations--and are all brushed aside by Landes in favor of his own controversial theory: that the ability to effect an industrial revolution is dependent on certain cultural traits, without which industrialization is impossible to sustain. Landes contrasts the characteristics of successfully industrialized nations--work, thrift, honesty, patience, and tenacity--with those of nonindustrial countries, arguing that until these values are internalized by all nations, the gulf between the rich and poor will continue to grow.David Landes is professor emeritus of history and economics at Harvard University. He is the author of Revolution in Time and Prometheus Unbound.

Released in October 2011, it chronicles Mike Dooley's life, from fear to fortune. It shares exactly how, in spite of DOUBT, UNCERTAINTY and NO LIGHT at the end of the tunnel, he prevailed, and it lays out exactly how anyone else can do the same. It's somewhat of an autobiographical account of how he personally lived and applied the wisdom he shared in&nbsp;<i>Infinite Possibilities</i>&nbsp;during the journey he began in 2000 when the old "TUT" wound down and he was in the harrowing place of starting his life over. It's the story of his journey through the seemingly unending parade of miracles and opportunities that presented themselves once he properly began leveraging the Universe and engaging the magic himself.<ul> </ul></p><p>When it comes to living the life of one's dreams, there are those who think they must go it alone; that they must be the early bird, know all the right people, and succeed by the sweat of their brow - and they carry the weight of the world on their shoulders.<br><br> Then there are those who have read all the books, done all the workshops, and concluded that it's simply a matter of surrendering to a loving, conspiring Universe so that their life might be transformed by its magic - and they silently wonder why it hasn't.<br><br> The truth is, neither are we alone, nor is knowing about the Universe and its magic enough to manifest change. The first conclusion is as self-sabotaging as it is sad, and the second is a bit like knowing exactly where the secret treasure is buried, yet never bothering to dig for it. Instead, the trick lies in knowing the difference between what one can, should and must do, versus what one can, should and must delegate to an all wise and capable Universe. Our part is the easy part.<br><br> We need only provide the spark to light the Universe's fire; to hoist up our sails so that they can be filled with its magical winds. Yet without offering these token efforts, without assisting in these modest ways, not only do we contradict our wish to live as fully as possible, but we slide ever further away from an infinite grace that tirelessly strives to sweep us off our feet, surround us with friends, and create the life we most want.<br><br> <i>Leveraging the Universe: 7 Steps to Engaging Life's Magic</i>&nbsp;is about using the gifts of thought, word, and deed to harness this grace. It's about doing the least to get the most. Learning what "the truth" is, and how to live it, so that the kingdom, the power, and the glory can be revealed before your very eyes, as you discover your holy place in creation - as a creator, yourself.<br><br> <i>Slayer of dragons, matador of time and space, rightful heir to heaven on earth, it's time to be living the life of your dreams.</i><br><i></i><br> Your great admirer,<br> Mike<b>"You can't know where or when the Universe will enter your affairs-- only that it will.

The little bluestem, the big bluestem, switch, Indian, and grama grasses are green after their winter sleep, and the wildflowers display a variety of colors. Groves of post oak, blackjack, and eastern red cedar dot the landscape. Countless birds, including rare black-?capped vireos, search for nourishment. Everywhere there is a promise of nurture and it warms the soul, as do the warm and gentle breezes from the south. The Wichita Mountains are about 300 million years old, and among the oldest mountain ranges on earth. They consist of two rugged ranges of red granite reaching nearly 2,500 feet at the highest point. They run several miles east and west and enclose a natural prairie where buffalo, elk, prairie dogs, and other wildlife still roam in what is today the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. While the Wichitas may lack the majesty of the Rocky Mountains, they are impressive islands projecting upward from a sea of rolling prairie.<br><br>The Wichitas are rich in lore which includes legends of Indian battles and Spanish treasure. The Spanish penetrated the area in the 1600s, and French traders first traversed the region during the 1770s. Long before the first Europeans arrived, Indians found protection from their enemies in the Wichitas. They also found solace at what is called Medicine Bluff, located near the eastern edge of the mountains. The bluff rises three hundred feet above a creek whose waters were thought by Indians to have special qualities. Indians&#x2014;Wichitas, Comanches, and Kiowas&#x2014;most likely named the bluff in their native languages, designing it as a place of mystery with great spiritual powers. The first white men in the area named it Medicine Bluff after learning of this Indian belief. The word <i>medicine</i> probably derived from <i>m�decin</i>, the French word for physician, which early French fur traders would have introduced into North America. The term was widely applied by whites. In time, Indians used the word to identify their own healing methods and spiritual mysteries. <br><br>Medicine Bluff is just one of countless natural places with distinctive features that Indians believed had special spiritual power because they could not rationally explain why they existed. Such natural places conveyed to them the essence of a religious experience but were not actually worshipped. Not all things with spiritual power, to be sure, were natural. Indians created smoking pipes, bundles, and other objects that became sacred and powerful once the makers performed special rituals to imbue them with qualities of sacredness or good medicine. For the American Indian, almost anything could attain such a therapeutic or mystical quality, emphasizing how great a role spiritual power plays in Indian medicine. <br><br>In &#x201c;Letter Six&#x201d; of his <i>Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs, and Conditions of North American Indians</i> (1844), the artist George Catlin noted that &#x201c;Indian country is full of doctors, and as they are all magicians, and skilled, or profess to be skilled in many mysteries, the word &#x2018;medicine&#x2019; has become habitually applied to every thing mysterious or unaccountable and the English and Americans...have easily and familiarly adopted the same word, with a slight alteration, conveying the same meaning; and to be a little more explicit, they have denominated these personages &#x2018;medicine-men,&#x2019; which means something more than merely a doctor or physician.&#x201d; <br><br>Catlin related that every Plains Indian male has a medicine bag. When a boy is fourteen or fifteen, he leaves his father&#x2019;s lodge, locates a secluded spot, cries out to the Great Spirit, and fasts. At night, he sleeps on the ground. He may stay there from two to five days, or until he dreams of an animal, bird, or reptile in his sleep. He believes the first such creature to appear to him in a dream is his protector for life, so designated by the Great Spirit. The young Indian then returns to the lodge of his father, tells of his dream, breaks his fast, and leaves again to find and kill the animal, bird, or reptile in question. After killing it, he skins it and uses the full skin to fashion his medicine bag, which he stuffs with grass, or moss, or something of the kind. He then closes it and will rarely open it again. He will carry the bag throughout his life, frequently paying homage to it and looking to it for safety and protection. Catlin saw medicine bags made from a variety of creatures, including otter, beaver, muskrat, weasel, raccoon, skunk, frog, toad, bat, mouse, mole, hawk, eagle, magpie, sparrow, and even a wolf. The size of the skin determines the size of the bag. When its owner dies, the medicine bag is placed with his remains. <br><br>Indians practiced their medicine long before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. Believing he had reached the Indies, Columbus called the natives Indians, a name that stuck. Since most native cultures in North America were exclusively oral, the recorded history of Indian medicine begins with the arrival of the Europeans and their written observations. One exception was the Aztecs in what is now Mexico, who did have written records. After the Spanish arrived in 1519, however, most of these records were destroyed with great zeal. The Spanish did express their amazement at the Aztecs&#x2019; vast knowledge of medicinal plants, and noted that their practice of medicine was an intrinsic part of their spiritual life. <br><br>At the time, Europeans used the word medicine to describe any substance, regimen, or physical procedure that had a beneficial effect on the human body and restored health, and they viewed medicine as separate from religion. Among Indians, however, their medicine encompassed much more. &#x201c;While they used herbal remedies to treat simple physical conditions such as burns, broken bones, sore eyes, and dislocations, the majority of Indian medicine was used to cure conditions which had no obvious physical cause,&#x201d; writes one authority, Clara Sue Kidwell. &#x201c;Symptoms included not only overt aches and pains, but could include what modern medicine might term neuroses, any behavior that was excessive or out of the ordinary.... Illness is a matter of balance and harmony with one&#x2019;s physical surroundings, spiritual environment, and social group. Thus, it goes far beyond mere physical symptoms. If one&#x2019;s balance is disturbed (witchcraft is a good example of how fear of an individual as a witch can have a disruptive effect in a group of people), illness results.&#x201d;<br><br>Eric Stone, a Rhode Island physician, wrote in 1932 that Indian &#x201c;mythology and theology are peculiarly rich and endowed with an unexpected symbolism and beauty, bespeaking an unusual ability to express their emotional and esthetic appreciation of their all-?important physical environment. Their m�tier was not pictorial, but lay, on the one hand, in decorative design and, on the other, in a wealth of folklore and poetry.&#x201d;<br><br>Anthropologists, ethnologists, and historians tell us that early Indian medicine was closely tied to their reverence for nature and its supernatural powers. Indians lived most of their lives out of doors, and nature charmed them, but, as Clara Sue Kidwell points out, &#x201c;Nature is threatening as often as it is benevolent. Ceremonies were held to restore balance that had been disrupted, or to assure that balance continued and nature produced the results that the people desired. The natural environment of the Great Plains was a source of spiritual power for individuals through vision quests, but vision questing required the endurance of pain and physical deprivation&#x2014;sleep, food, water. Going alone into special places where spirits were thought to make their presence known was a way of acquiring access to that power. Going alone into the environment could also be a source of illness if one encountered a spiritual being without proper preparation.&#x201d;<br><br>In most tribes, the principal person overseeing such matters was a medicine man or sometimes a medicine woman. After the arrival of the Spanish in the Southwest, this person was often called a <i>curandero</i> (or <i>curandera)</i>, but ethnologists have sometimes used the Asian term <i>shaman</i>, defined by Merriam-Webster as a priest or priestess who uses magic for curing the sick. Kidwell, however, points out that a shaman or medicine man&#x2019;s role is not just in healing, nor is it necessarily one of high prestige. The shaman or medicine man/woman supposedly had learned to control and use the spiritual power of nature. At the same time it followed for the people who believed in his or her powers that those powers might be used to do harm as well as to help. Moreover, Kidwell added that &#x201c;being a shaman is also a dangerous position for the individual who must confront the power that is causing the illness and uses his or her power to exorcise it or bring it under control. If the curer&#x2019;s power weakens, the illness may affect him or her.&#x201d;<br><br>Whatever their title, such individuals received what others believed was a vision or a deep spiritual insight into their patients. They never lost sight of the spiritual side of health and disease, realizing the power of the mind. Most were viewed as wise, as knowing the secrets of healing, and as visionaries who mastered death. They were thought to be able to go into a trance, leave their bodies, and visit unearthly kingdoms. Some were also poets and singers who danced and created works of art. Their medicine simply denoted a spiritual power used for many purposes including healing with natural herbs and plants. <br><br>The role of the shaman varied from tribe to tribe. The Harvard anthropologist Roland B. Dixon wrote in 1908 that in numerous instances the position of shaman descended by inheritance in either the male or the female line, depending upon the prevailing tribal system of descent...</p>
